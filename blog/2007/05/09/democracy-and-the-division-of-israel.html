<div class="entry-content"><p>With the Lebanon war behind us, and Israeli politicians trying to do
anything to divert attention from the damning Winograd Commission
findings, the lie that Israel must surrender its Arab-dominated biblical
heartland in order to survive as both a Jewish state and a democracy is
again a favorite topic of discussion. Earlier this week, Defense
Minister Amir Peretz blasted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for failing to
come up with a new diplomatic plan vis-a-vis the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; after
the Lebanon war forced him to shelve his proposed &#8220;realignment.&#8221; Now a
<a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010030">top Israeli political
analyst</a>
says Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is again formulating what she believes
is a &#8220;realistic&#8221; vision for peace. Livni has <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/843">done this once
before</a>, parroting the popular
&#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; that Israel simply cannot hold on to Judea,
Samaria and Gaza because doing so would upset the demographic balance in
the Jewish state. <a href="http://www.westernresistance.com/blog/archives/003736.html">Ruy Diaz correctly notes over at Western
Resistance</a>
that Israel needs to actually defeat its enemies before any peace plan
has a chance of succeeding. You simply <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/03/06/you-cant-make-peace-with-a-violent-people">cannot make peace with an
undefeated
enemy</a>
still bent on your ultimate demise. But even if we were at a point that
peace deals could realistically be discussed, the argument that Israel
can only survive as a Jewish-dominated democracy by surrendering its
most strategically-valuable pieces of land <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2006/06/18/no-demographic-threat">is
ridiculous</a>.
First of all, Israel, displaying unbelievable foolishness, is relying on
Palestinian Authority-provided statistics to determine the exact
demographic balance west of the Jordan River. <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/601">Surveys guided by
scientific methods</a> rather than
Islamic interests show that the PA numbers are way off, and that Jews
are not in the minority west of the Jordan. What&#8217;s more is that there
are about 12 million Jews who do not yet live in Israel that any number
of circumstances could cause to suddenly immigrate to the land of their
forefathers. At any given time, Israel&#8217;s Jewish population could
suddenly double, or even triple. But what I really wish is that Israel&#8217;s
leaders would put aside all the numbers and statistics, and display the
kind of blind faith that those who participated in the rebirth of Israel
had 60 years ago. Jews were most decidedly <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm">a minority west of the
Jordan River prior to Israel&#8217;s Declaration of
Independence</a>. The British and
their &#8220;white papers&#8221; had made sure of that. But that did not deter David
Ben Gurion and those around him from pressing forward with the
fulfillment of a 2,000-year-old dream. Back then, Israelis knew that
somehow, despite being a minority in the land, they would prevail. The
same is undoubtedly true today. If Israel would only have the faith to
lay claim to all of its biblical birthright, it would find the numbers
miraculously working out in the Jews&#8217; favor, just as they did 60 years
ago.</p>
