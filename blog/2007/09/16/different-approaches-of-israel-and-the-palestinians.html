<div class="entry-content"><p>Israel and the so-called &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; Arabs have been locked in
conflict for over 40 years now and in that time - especially over the
last decade - it has become very clear that while one side is going to
great and even exaggerated lengths to foster peace and coexistence, the
other plainly is not. The latest example of the Palestinians&#8217; approach
to their peace partners came last week, when a rocket fired from the
Gaza Strip wounded 69 young Israeli soldiers. Rather than denounce the
attack as a hindrance to peace and an unacceptable assault on their
peace partners, the Palestinians <a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/09/overwhelming-joy-at-rocket-attack.html">erupted in rapturous
celebration</a>,
which was enthusiastically covered by the Palestinian media. Isn&#8217;t it
telling that after 10 years of purported peace-making, the Palestinians
still hate Israel so deeply that the maiming and wounding of so many
young Jewish soldiers would bring them such joy? Can you imagine the
world response if Israelis spontaneously exploded in demonstrations of
triumph and jubilation whenever Palestinians were killed in Israeli
military operations? Of course, it is little wonder that the
Palestinians can so enjoy the pain and suffering of others when they
view those others as subhuman. This is how the speaker of the elected
Palestinian parliament <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=36020">referred to the Jews of Israel during a public
televised address last month</a>:
> The liberation of Jerusalem will not be achieved by means of
glittering slogans, cheap arrogance, and degrading concessions. It will
be achieved by realizing the divine path in the souls of the Muslims,
and by raising the generation of the coming victory to lead the battle
against the **brothers of apes and pigs**. On the flip side of the
coin, former Israeli army chief of staff Moshe Ya&#8217;alon recently noted
the <a href="http://www.omedia.org/Show_Article.asp?DynamicContentID=2584&amp;MenuID=603">unbelievable and unprecedented
situation</a>
whereby Israel is providing water, electrical and other infrastructure
services to a Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip that is fully at war with the
Jewish state. Despite the wild accusations that are often leveled
against Israel, the Jewish state actually fulfills Jesus&#8217; command to
&#8220;love your enemy&#8221; more dutifully than most Christians. The services
Israel provides to the Palestinian public, the medical care it give
wounded Palestinian terrorists, etc are equal to what it does for its
own citizens. Israel is in effect loving its enemy as it loves itself.
Often Israel even goes overboard and loves its enemy more than it loves
itself. Consider that Arab terrorists jailed for murdering Jews in acts
of brutal terrorism are often freed in gestures of goodwill, whereas an
Israeli Jew in jail for committing a criminal murder would never have
his or her sentence similarly commuted. Israel&#8217;s Arab enemies are
afforded a degree of understanding for their murderous behavior that
Jewish criminals do not even receive. That is overdoing the love a
little bit. What the hypocritical and god-less governments of the West
refuse to take into consideration when formulating their next big &#8220;peace
push&#8221; is that for decades now Israel has been treating its enemies in
his human, even Christ-like manner and it has achieved nothing. In fact,
the Arabs&#8217; resolve to destroy Israel is arguably stronger today than it
was 30 years ago. (I am not talking about the Arab leaders who say all
the right things in order to receive US dollars. I am talking about the
Arab masses whose venomous hatred of the Jewish state has certainly not
waned.) Further evidence that all the human efforts and goodwill in the
world is not going to produce peace in the Middle East. Better to stick
to God&#8217;s Word regarding control of the Land and Israel&#8217;s rights here,
and wait for the one true peacemaker to arrive.</p>
