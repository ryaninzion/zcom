<div class="entry-content"><p>The popular Christian magazine _Christianity Today_ recently lent its
support to a letter signed by 34 US Evangelical leaders <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/30/christian-support-for-palestine-smacks-of-replacement-theology">urging
President George W. Bush to continue down his path of dividing the Land
of
Israel</a>.
The magazine then carried an article <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/september/16.24.html">defending its decision to support
that
call</a>.
With all due respect, it appears _Christianity Today_ has, like so
many American churches, allowed secular humanism to creep in and
influence its views on the current conflict. The author of the recent
_Christianity Today_ article says a lot that I can agree with
pertaining to the continued position of the Children of Israel as the
apple of God&#8217;s eye and of the necessity for us as Gentile believers to
realize that we have been grafted into Israel&#8217;s tree of faith. > We
cannot read the New Testament without seeing that the Jews continue to
have a place in God&#8217;s economy. Gentile Christians do not replace the
Jews, but are joint heirs and wild branches grafted onto the Jewish
olive tree. God&#8217;s ultimate purpose in saving Gentile Christians is to
save the Jews (Rom. 11). OK so far, but that is where it starts to break
down for me. The author goes on to suggest that while the Bible may deed
a far greater area of land to Israel than what it today has full
sovereignty over, our Christian obligations toward others forbid us to
support Israel&#8217;s rule over a “Palestinian” population that does not
desire it. > While the most vocal Christian Zionists call for Israel to
possess all of the Davidic “Greater Israel,“ such goals come at too high
a price. The author justifies this position by noting that the majority
of Israelis, even those who do dream of possessing all of the Promised
Land, realize they cannot rule over such a large population of Arabs and
therefore must abandon the hope of a complete fulfillment of God&#8217;s
promises. They must abandon the borders that God Himself drew for Israel
because of the sensitivities and protests of the Muslim world. This is a
very wrong position for a Bible-believer to take. The Israelis who think
this way, even if they are a majority, are failing to fully put their
faith in God and in His promises. We should not be encouraging them to
behave in such a way, and we certainly should not be joining them in
doing so. Fortunately, David Ben Gurion and his contemporaries did not
allow themselves to be influenced by such demographic nonsense and
declared independence despite the Jews being a minority west of the
Jordan River at the time. **Trust in God and in His Word should cause
us to stand firm on His promises even when present circumstances don&#8217;t
appear to be in our favor.** The editors of _Christianity Today_,
while they seem to recognize the continued central importance of Israel
and her restoration in God&#8217;s plans, apparently fail to realize that the
enemy is naturally doing everything in his power to thwart or at least
stall the fulfillment of those plans. That means hindering the
restoration of the land to Israel and of Israel to the land. It is not
wrong to hope and pray for and even try to facilitate a better life for
the Arabs, though their salvation from Islam should be our first
concern. However, by giving succor to the Arab “cause” of dividing and
eventually overrunning the Land of Israel, these Christians are in fact
aiding the schemes of the enemy of our Lord. Another couple of biblical
points I would like to make that contradict the position _Christianity
Today_ has taken are these: 1. The Lord clearly warns against efforts
to divide “My land,” and speaks of severe judgement for those who do
(Joel 3:2). By urging Bush to press on with his “two-state solution,”
these Christians are urging their leader to become one of those the Lord
speaks out against. 2. As Christians, we should recognize that there
will be no peace in the Middle East between Israel and her neighbors
until Messiah returns (Isaiah 2:2, 4) and establishes his rule with an
iron rod (Psalm 2:9). We are called to be peacemakers, but not in a
manner that runs contrary to the rest of God&#8217;s Word and puts us in the
camp of those scorned by the prophets and destined to suffer severe
judgement. That last point speaks to an issue regarding the Church in
America that has bothered me for some time, and that is the fingerprints
of secular humanism that can be seen in so many of the Church&#8217;s views
regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict. God has determined quite clearly
that this land belongs to Him (Leviticus 25:23), and that His intention
is to restore it to Israel (Amos 9:14-15). While God does care about
each of us personally, the fulfillment of our personal desires is far
less important than the fulfillment of His divine will. That the
Palestinian Arabs desire to have their own sovereign nation on this
small piece of land should for us pale in comparison to the expressed
will of God. It is secular humanism that denies Israel its biblical
birthright as a result of Arab whining. Those Arabs refuse to accept the
word, promises and will of God. We should not join them. The
Palestinians&#8217; plight is not rooted in Israel&#8217;s restoration, but rather
in their failure to accept the Lord God of Israel and get in line with
His will. At present, they are pawns of the enemy in his effort to
thwart and hinder God&#8217;s plans. It is wrong for us as Christians to help
keep the Palestinians in this state, when we should be seeking their
salvation from Islam and the clutches of Allah. The position represented
by the editors of _Christianity Today_ and those other Evangelical
leaders who signed that ill-advised letter to Bush is more in line with
politically correct secular humanism than with the Word of God. Also
