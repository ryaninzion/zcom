<div class="entry-content"><p>The issue of so-called “illegal” Jewish settlement outposts in Judea and
Samaria is often in the news, and can present a difficulty for Israel
advocates when confronted by detractors of the Jewish state. It is,
therefore, important for Israel&#8217;s friends abroad to educate themselves
on this topic so as to be able to effectively argue Israel&#8217;s case even
opposite those who have no interest in the Bible and the legitimacy it
lends the Jewish people in settling the land. Jameel over at the Muqata
has posted an <a href="http://muqata.blogspot.com/2007/09/illegal-unauthorized-outposts-faq.html">excellent
FAQ</a>
regarding the status and history of these outposts, providing more than
enough ammunition for those who find themselves defending Israel&#8217;s right
to build in its biblical heartland. The most important part of the FAQ
is the point dealing with whether or not the outposts are illegal under
Israeli law: > The government-commissioned Sasson report admitted that
“from the beginning of the nineties&#8230;governmental bodies and public
authorities&#8230;played a central role in establishing the outposts“. In
other words, the outposts were without any doubt sanctioned by
governmental authorities. There may not have been an official public
government decision to establish many of these outposts, but the fact
remains that the Defense Ministry, army and all other relevant parts of
the government sanctioned and aided the building of these tiny
communities. How else would roads and infrastructure have reached most
of the outposts? Of course, Israel&#8217;s foreign detractors will say that
the outposts, and indeed all the settlements, violate international law,
and are therefore “illegal.” But this is a dubious position, to say the
least. International law states that a nation may not occupy a portion
of another nation and build settlements on that land. However, the “West
Bank” was never a recognized part of another nation. The UN offered the
Arabs of the West Bank their own state in 1948. They turned down the
offer and went to war with Israel instead. It is important to note that
Resolution 181 was not a legally binding resolution - in other words it
did not establish an Arab state in the West Bank, it merely suggested
that the Jews and Arabs west of the Jordan River divide the land between
them. Jordan then occupied the West Bank from 1948-1967, though that
occupation was deemed illegal by the international community. It was
under this status - as a disputed non-sovereign territory - that the
West Bank came under Israeli control during the Six Day War. Because no
nation had ever exercised legitimate sovereign control over the West
Bank, Israel&#8217;s settlements were not built on occupied foreign territory.
Furthermore, there were Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria prior
to 1948, and those settlements were granted legitimacy by the
international community in the Mandate for Palestine bestowed on Great
Britain in 1920. In fact, the only legally binding piece of
international law dealing with control of Judea and Samaria - the 1920
San Remo Conference declaration - <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/06/06/israels-legal-occupation">unequivocally deeds that land to the
Jews</a>. Than
any Jewish presence in the West Bank is “illegal” is a modern myth
invented by the Arabs as part of their concocted “Palestinian cause” and
willingly propagated by the mainstream media.</p>
