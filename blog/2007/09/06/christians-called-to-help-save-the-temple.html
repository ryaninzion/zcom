<div class="entry-content"><p>A Jewish organization dedicated to preparing for the day the Temple in
Jerusalem will be rebuilt has issued a call for help from
Bible-believing Christians around the world amid escalating Muslim
efforts to erase any physical connection between Jerusalem&#8217;s Temple
Mount and the God of Israel. Folks, the issue of the Temple Mount is an
important one. Ezekiel chapters 43 and 44 suggest that when Messiah
returns, he will enter the Temple Mount and return with him the glory of
the Lord to the Temple. That means this building needs to be rebuilt
before Messiah will return. Why else would the enemy be so intent on
thwarting any possibility of the Jews ever constructing the Temple
described in great detail in Ezekiel chapters 40-48? Many Christians,
even staunch supporters of Israel, insist that because the spirit of God
now dwells in us that He has abandoned the holy hill where He
sovereignly decided to place His name FOREVER (1 Kings 9:3). But forever
means forever, so just because the blood of the lamb has made it
possible for the spirit of God to now dwell in us does not mean the
Temple Mount has been forsaken. Many other Christians know that the
Temple will and must be rebuilt, but believe that we have no role to
play in this, that we can just sit back and wait for God to accomplish
His will. This position ignores the fact that God has historically
worked through men to accomplish His will. It also fails to take into
consideration what our answer will be on the day we stand before the
Lord and He asks what we were doing while Allah was trying to complete
his conquest of the place our God placed His name. And so I think it is
important for everyone to read this plea for help from our Jewish
brethren at <a href="http://www.templeinstitute.org/news.htm">the Temple
Institute</a> who, like us, seek
to be zealous for the name of the Lord and to prepare the way for the
King of Kings: > The Christian people must rise up and stand with their
brethren in Israel and make their voices heard to stop this travesty. We
are asking Christians to do everything possible to petition the Israeli
government to halt the Waqf [Islamic Trust] destruction and have
archaeologists immediately inspect the area. A WorldNetDaily article
<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57476">covering this
appeal</a>
provides this address for emailing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s office:
<a href="mailto:pm_eng@pmo.gov.il">pm_eng@pmo.gov.il</a> The letter to Christians
continues: > As a result of destructive and wanton bulldozing by the
Waqf - with Israeli permission - a section of the wall of the Holy
Temple in the area universally recognized as the location of the Women&#8217;s
Court has been unearthed. This is the first time since the destruction
of the Second Temple that actual physical evidence of the Temple has
been revealed. But all of the antiquities of the Temple that have been
uncovered are in danger of being destroyed if you don&#8217;t help. > > &#8230;
> > This is an attack by enemies of the G-d of Israel against Him, and
His plan for all humanity. The Bible consistently emphasizes the
centrality of the Holy Temple in the life of mankind; it is none other
than the “footstool“ of G-d in this world (Lam 2:1). The purposeful
destruction of remnants of the Holy Temple are an attempt to undermine
G-d&#8217;s sovereignty, and to erase His name from the one place on earth
that He has chosen to manifest His presence throughout the saga of human
history. > > &#8230; > > Aside from the political implications regarding
the future of Jerusalem and Israel and the direct effect that this will
have on the entire world - the spiritual implications of what is now
transpiring are enormous. > > Allowing this sacrilege to continue, or
alternatively - expending every effort to stem it, will constitute a
direct indication as to how much we are willing to commit to the
promises of G-d, and how much are we willing to commit to upholding His
honor. > > The Bible clearly indicates that all humanity will be
uplifted to a new and unparalleled level of unity when the Holy Temple
is rebuilt. “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
mountain of the L-rd&#8217;s house shall be established on the top of the
mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all the nations
shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us
go up to the mountain of the L-rd&#8230;” (Isaiah 2). > > &#8230; > > This
is the time for action. &#8230;I urge all those of you who stand with the
people of Israel, who express deep commitment and concern for her fate,
who identify with her mission and cherish her G-d, to rise up together
with your brethren, the faithful, observant and G-d fearing Jews, and
make your voices heard. > > &#8230; > > I urge each and every true
friend of Israel to personally fulfill the verse “For Zion&#8217;s sake I will
not hold my peace, and for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not be
still&#8230;“ (Isaiah 62:1). Do not be silent, do not be still! Make your
voices heard in the clearest possible manner. Look deeply into your
hearts, seek guidance from our Creator, and decide upon your course of
action - a course that will allow you the merit of participating in
G-d&#8217;s unfolding plan of redemption for all mankind. A course of action
that will make it clear in the most unequivocal terms, to Israel&#8217;s
enemies - from within and without - that you stand for the honor of the
G-d of Israel. > > Rabbi Chaim Richman > Director, International
Department > The Temple Institute The email address for Olmert&#8217;s office
again: <a href="mailto:pm_eng@pmo.gov.il">pm_eng@pmo.gov.il</a> I leave it to all
of you to obtain the contact information of your local and national
representatives and to make sure they are aware of what is going on and
that you, as Bible-believing Christians, will not stand for it. For a
thorough look at why the Temple Mount is playing so prominently in these
days from a Christian perspective, head over to Stan Goodenough&#8217;s blog
