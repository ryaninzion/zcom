<div class="entry-content"><p>It is no secret to those with their eyes open that even the so-called
“moderate” Palestinians belonging to Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; Fatah movement are
neck-deep in the blood of Israeli Jews and see violence as a useful and
legitimate tool in obtaining its goals. For those still on the fence on
this issue, Fatah commanders themselves are now admitting that their
group employs a strategy of sowing with the gun and reaping with
politics. Earlier this summer, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
decided to grant amnesty to 178 Fatah terrorists as a gesture of
goodwill toward Abbas and in an effort to bolster his fragile regime,
which had recently suffered a stunning military defeat at the hand of
Hamas in Gaza. Israeli and foreign media outlets portrayed the Fatah
members participating in the move as almost repenting of their past
violence and converting to the path of dialogue. The truth, however, is
that these groups - even the “moderate” Fatah and their supporters among
the general public - believe terrorist violence against Israeli Jews is
a necessary component of their overall negotiation strategy. The
Bethlehem-based Ma&#8217;an news agency recently interviewed Abu Jabal, a
local field commander of Fatah&#8217;s Al Aqsa Brigades “military wing” in the
Samarian town of Nablus (biblical Shechem). Abu Jabal, who was among
those granted amnesty, had this to say of the <a href="http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=25171">relationship between
Palestinian violence and
negotiations</a>:
> We have a saying in Fatah: With the gun we plant and with the
politics we harvest. A colleague, Abu Skandar, jumped in on the
interview to point out that the Fatah men did not intend to abide by the
documents they signed renouncing the use of violence against Israelis
forever. > We want to give politicians an opportunity, [but] we have
not absolutely abandoned fighting. Abu Jabal also stressed that he and
his men did not agree to the amnesty deal because they suddenly feel
remorse for attacking Jewish men, women and children, but rather because
doing so presently serves Palestinian interests: > We agreed to this
because it benefits the Palestinian people. This is “moderate” Islam,
this is the behavior of the most moderate Palestinians. It is a mistake
to see news reports of “moderate” Palestinian leaders and assume that
their moderation and behavior mirrors that of moderate folks in the
West. Our leaders in the West, however, are going to great lengths to
ignore that discrepancy. They are putting their own short-term political
interests first by pretending that people like Abbas and Abu Jabal hold
views equal to our own when it comes to terrorist activity. These
leaders refuse to acknowledge Arab admissions of remaining committed to
terrorist violence because doing so would pull the rug out from under
their own political agendas.</p>
