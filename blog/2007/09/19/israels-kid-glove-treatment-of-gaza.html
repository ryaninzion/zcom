<div class="entry-content"><p>The Palestinians and the international media do their best to convince
the world that Israel is treating the Gaza Strip in a brutal and
oppressive manner. The truth is that Israel&#8217;s leadership is very
stubbornly refusing to take off its kid gloves in dealing with the
mounting threat from Hamas-controlled Gaza, to the continued detriment
of both Israel and the Arabs of Gaza. On Wednesday, the government of
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made a show of combating the Gaza threat by
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3451149,00.html">dramatically declaring the volatile coastal strip a “hostile enemy
territory.”</a>
It is a move that will accomplish absolutely nothing. Years ago, as
Yasser Arafat&#8217;s uprising against Israel was getting into full swing, the
government of Ariel Sharon declared the terror icon and his regime
enemies of the Jewish state. The decision gained a lot of international
press coverage, as well as a lot of international scorn, while doing
absolutely nothing to slow down the Palestinian terrorist onslaught. The
moment Arafat was dead the international community fully brushed aside
Israel&#8217;s conclusion that the entire Palestinian regime had become
hostile, and insisted that the time had arrived to rush to a final
status peace agreement. Even less effective will be the limited
sanctions the cabinet also approved on Wednesday. The ministers said
they are ready to cut Israel&#8217;s supply of electricity and fuel to Gaza
(can you believe Israel is still providing these things?), but also
rejected the idea of doing anything that would too adversely affect the
civilian population. Well, cutting electricity and fuel will adversely
affect the civilian population in a very visible way, so you can be sure
the reduction of these basic services will be token in scope. The only
effective solution to the Gaza rocket problem is the one that Olmert&#8217;s
cabinet unanimously rejected - a full ground invasion of Gaza and the
possible reinstating of long-term Israeli control. Security and defense
experts, including some of Olmert&#8217;s own ministers, have been warning for
years that the only way to really curb the threat of rockets from Gaza
is to go in with overwhelming force and crush the local terrorist
infrastructure. Those same experts also warn that any alternative move
that does not eliminate the ability of Hamas and other groups to make
war on Israelis will only encourage the terrorists to continue down
their path of violence. Hamas and their terrorist allies do not need to
actually defeat Israel militarily, just as Hizballah did not need to
actually win the war with Israel last summer. They just had to survive
the war with Israel. That a small terrorist militia went to war with the
mighty Israeli army and survived while inflicting damage on Israeli
civilians was enough to boost Hizballah&#8217;s image among the Arab world
immeasurably. Israel is handing Hamas the same type of victory. Nor does
Hamas care about the suffering of the people living under their control.
In fact, the more the local population suffers from Israeli sanctions
and limited military strikes, the more public relations ammunition Hamas
has. If Israel really cares about putting Hamas out of business and
about ending the suffering of the Arabs of Gaza, it should listen to
those experts who advocate crushing, one-time military action that will
end Hamas&#8217; very ability to function and at the same time end the need
for ongoing Israeli military reprisals that inadvertently harm the
civilian population.</p>
