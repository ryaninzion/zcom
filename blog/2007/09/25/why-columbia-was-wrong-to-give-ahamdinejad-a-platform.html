<div class="entry-content"><p>Much is being made of Columbia University&#8217;s decision to let Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad address its student body in the name of
free speech and critical dialogue. Proponents of the decision insist
that the event provided an opportunity to publicly confront the Iranian
regime&#8217;s repression of basic freedoms, denial of the Holocaust and
refusal to accept Israel&#8217;s right to exist in a public forum for all the
world to see. According to this naive thinking, the exchange at Columbia
should have served to expose the fallacy of Ahmadinejad&#8217;s positions,
thereby undercutting his support base and encouraging opposition to his
policies at home. However, it is a near certainty that the portions of
Monday&#8217;s event in which Ahmadinejad was scorned for his views or was
booed and heckled by the audience will never air in Iran. Instead,
Iranian state-controlled television will broadcast those parts of the
event in which their president was loudly applauded by the liberals in
the audience. Those scenes and the very fact that Ahmadinejad was
invited to speak at one of America&#8217;s most prominent universities are
going to provide him with a tremendous amount of prestige and legitimacy
in Iran and the Middle East, and will instead undercut his detractors.
Supporters of having the Tyrant of Tehran at Columbia also say that
American university students must be exposed to the different ideologies
and concepts that are out there, and should not hinder free speech and
the exchange of ideas, regardless of how offensive they may be to our
own sensitivities. Tellingly, Columbia regularly denies the right of
political conservatives to ascend the same platform. As an example of
the depth of Columbia&#8217;s hypocrisy, consider that at Monday&#8217;s event
Ahmadinejad insisted there are no homosexuals in Iran, which is another
way of saying he and his nation&#8217;s religious overlords will not allow
homosexuality in Iran. This position was known beforehand, yet
Ahmadinejad was invited to speak anyway, while recruiters with the US
military&#8217;s ROTC training program are barred from the campus because of
the military&#8217;s “don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell” policy regarding homosexuality.
The worst part about letting Ahmadinejad speak at Columbia University,
however, was that it lent a certain degree of legitimacy to not only the
man, but also to his venomous views. Even if no one at Columbia agreed
with Ahmadinejad regarding his revisionist view of the Nazi Holocaust
and his desire to see Israel destroyed (not to mention his regime&#8217;s
repressive practices at home) allowing him to engage the student body
and the American people at large in dialogue essentially announced that
we consider these topics to be open for discussion. It has been rightly
noted that Columbia is not alone among major American universities in
behaving thus. The combination of naivety and hypocrisy that plagues
Columbia University is increasingly prevalent throughout America
academia, and is like a Trojan Horse opening the doors to our most
dedicated enemies.</p>
