<div class="entry-content"><p>Israel this week marked 40 years since its stunning victory over vastly
superior Arab forces in the 1967 Six Day War. The rest of the world
remembered the event by unleashing a flood of criticism over Israel&#8217;s
continued “occupation” of Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. When
Israel&#8217;s detractors speak of the “illegal occupation” they are basing
their position on UN Security Council Resolution 242. However, an honest
examination of the resolution and the subsequent events of of the past
four decades reveals that Israel&#8217;s control of these territories in fact
constitutes a legal occupation. The US and British authors of 242 were
deliberately ambiguous when they called for an Israeli withdrawal from
territories captured during the war. They did not demand that Israel
leave “the territories” or “all territories,” but simply “territories.”
Nor did they determine that Israel was required to hand lost territories
back to each of the three offending Arab states - Egypt, Syria and
Jordan. Again, the resolution simply says “from territories” without any
specification whatsoever regarding how much of each of the different
territories was to be returned. Since 1967, Israel has relinquished
control of well over 90% of the territories it captured in the Six Day
War, including the entire Sinai Peninsula, the whole of the Gaza Strip
and large portions of Judea and Samaria. It is safe to say from a legal
standpoint that Israel has fulfilled its primary obligation under
Resolution 242. What&#8217;s more, Jordan waived its right to complain about
receiving no land concessions from Israel when, in 1988, it publicly
backed Palestinian sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. With 242 satisfied,
and Jordan renouncing its claim to the “West Bank,” Israel&#8217;s possession
of Judea and Samaria as far as that landmark resolution is concerned is
absolutely legal. Taking the argument even further, it is important to
note that 242 and every other UN resolution regarding Israel and the
Middle East conflict since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948
have been passed under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. That means they are
in effect nothing more than recommendations on conflict resolution, and
not legally binding rulings. The last and only legally binding
international decision regarding control of the land remains the closing
statement of the 1920 League of Nations conference in San Remo, which
granted Great Britain the right to temporarily govern the area known as
“Palestine” with the intent of facilitating “close Jewish settlement” in
all of what is today Israel, the Palestinian-controlled territories and
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. That document - which, again,
constitutes international law - actually acknowledges the “historic ties
between the Jewish People and the Land of Israel,” which everyone in
1920 recognized as including Judea, Samaria, Gaza, the Golan Heights and
the mountainous territories east of the Jordan River. If the Palestinian
Arabs want to dispute Israel&#8217;s control over those areas based on their
own presence there, that is one thing. But to claim that their cause is
backed by modern international law is a grievous distortion of facts.
Unfortunately, in today&#8217;s world, dishonest slogan-based propaganda
usually wins out over truthful and thorough fact-checking in the battle
for people&#8217;s hearts and minds.</p>
