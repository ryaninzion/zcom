<div class="entry-content"><p>An Israeli investigative news television program carried a story last
night regarding a four-year-old Sudanese girl who was abducted by
Egyptian soldiers last month as she and her family tried to make their
way into Israel. Many Sudanese fleeing from the genocide in Darfur have
made their way to Egypt, only to find their hosts nearly as hostile as
the Arab militiamen who drove them from their homeland. Those who have
read a Bible or have knowledge of the Nazi Holocaust have then turned to
Israel and the Jews for refuge. In a telling display of their
hospitality, Egyptian soldiers have taken to shooting at desperate
Sudanese refugees as they make a dash for the border. Venus, the little
girl at the center of last night&#8217;s story, was a victim of one such
incident. When the Egyptians opened fire on Venus and her parents less
than 100 yards from the border, the frightened family began to run. But
little Venus&#8217; legs could not carry her fast enough, and the toddler was
separated from her parents in the chaos. After crossing the border,
Venus&#8217; parents turned around to see the girl had been taken by Egyptian
soldiers. They begged for her release, but the Egyptians refused and
demanded the parents return to their custody. The distraught mother and
father were then picked up by Israeli soldiers, who immediately began to
make calls to those who could assist in the situation. To make a long
story short, following five days of intense negotiations that involved
the heads of intelligence and the first ladies of both Israel and Egypt,
Venus was finally returned to her parents, who had by that time taken up
residence and been given jobs in the southern Israel resort town of
Eilat. As I watched this report I became infuriated at the fact that the
stories of Venus and so many others like her are being almost completely
ignored by the mainstream international press, the United Nations and
the loudmouth human rights organizations that are never at a loss for
words when it comes to criticizing Israel. Innocent people, refugees
with nothing but the shirts on their backs, are being shot at by heavily
armed soldiers for absolutely no reason other than to satisfy their
cruel urges. And no one says a word. Can anyone imagine the outcry if
Israeli soldiers were the ones firing on these poor souls? It gets
worse. Earlier this month, in my capacity as a reporter for <em>israel
today</em>, I <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=128&amp;view=item&amp;idx=1411">interviewed a Sudanese
refugee</a>
who had been in Egypt for about two years before coming to Israel. Among
other things, he recounted how in late 2005 the Sudanese in Egypt had
held a three-month mass demonstration opposite the UN&#8217;s office for
refugees in Cairo. Though the refugees were protesting against the UN
and its lethargic response to their situation, the Egyptians became fed
up, and ordered the Sudanese to vacate the square they had occupied.
When threats failed, the Egyptians turned to violence. This man told me
that one night in late December 2005, Egyptian soldiers surrounded the
thousands of Sudanese gathered in central Cairo - a gathering that
included a large number of women and small children - and doused them
all with water. The soldiers then sent massive electrical shocks through
the crowd, causing an untold number of injuries. Then it really started
to get bad. When the Sudanese continued to refuse to leave, the soldiers
began to beat and shoot at the unarmed refugees. At least 25 were
killed. Did anyone ever hear about this in the mainstream press? I
subsequently tried to look it up, and while some small Sudanese news
networks and a few personal blogs reported on the massacre, it appears
that not one major news outlet carried the story. UN officials here in
Israel later confirmed for me that this atrocity did in fact take place.
These stories provide further evidence that the international community
in general does not really care about the suffering of displaced,
dispossessed and oppressed peoples in other parts of the world. If the
world really cared, then there would have long ago been massive global
movements and special UN committees for the Sudanese, the Kurds, the
Tutsis of Rwanda, etc. The only reason these things exist for the
Palestinians - who by comparison represent almost a non-issue in terms
of human rights - is because Israel and the Jews are on the other side
of the equation. Mask it with whatever terms or special causes you want,
but anti-Semitism is alive and well today, and the proof is in the
enormously disproportionate attention received by those who claim to be
victims of the Jews.</p>
