<div class="entry-content"><p>I received the following email this week from a man whose US-based
ministry has long fought to defend Israel and its biblical right to this
land. He and others like him are urgently calling for all Israel-loving
Bible believers to make their way to Washington, DC and Annapolis,
Maryland to confront the latest satanic attempt to divide this land and
thwart God&#8217;s plans. > Jerusalem is in danger. The nation of Israel is
in danger. Our families and communities are in danger. There is a battle
raging, a revolution formulating and it is not focused on the Jews
alone. What we see happening in Israel today with the people who refer
to themselves as Palestinians is merely a war by proxy aimed at
controlling God&#8217;s very throne, the place where He said His name would be
known FOREVER, Jerusalem, more precisely Mount Moriah - the Temple
Mount. > > If Islam can dominate the land of Israel and push the Jews
into the Mediterranean (which to this day is the stated goal of PLO
charter) there will be no stabilizing force to hold back the pan-Arab
takeover of the Asian and African Continents, there will be no bridle in
the mouth of the descendants of Ishmael who God Himself foretold would
be a wild ass among men. Make no mistake about it, Islam is a revolution
on a global scale. The Imams are teaching that their pseudo-god provided
his faithful followers with an abundant supply of oil to fund the spread
of Islam throughout the Earth. The oil is running out with only another
twenty years left to accomplish their deed. This, to the point of total
domination, where the infidel or unbeliever is only allowed to survive
as a slave and is heavily taxed. This can already be seen happening in
most of the Islamic countries throughout the world today. > > My point
is this - Right now the framework is being set for an unprecedented take
over of Israel&#8217;s biblical inheritance. If Islam takes control of the
land now being proposed, not only will there not be peace in the Middle
East, the stage will be set for insurrection throughout the world.
<strong>There is a unique opportunity to make a stand to help protect Israel
from Arab aggression while never leaving American soil.</strong> We can make a
difference, together, at a time when Israel is having her arm twisted by
an administration desperate to create a legacy for itself at the expense
of the Jewish people. > > We can lift our voices in opposition at the
front of the White House and at the front gate of the Annapolis Naval
Academy. Permits to assemble have been secured at both venues on the
dates of the conference in Annapolis. We need voices. We need faithful
believers who can come together and say to the mountain of political
coercion facing Israel, be removed. > > A coalition of Jewish and
Christian organizations is working together to rally support for Israel
and defend Jerusalem from Arab aggression. The dates for the rallies are
November 25 at the White House and the 26th and 27th at Annapolis. > >
Sincerely, > Ed Warmoth > Builders of Zion Executive Director >

407-971-7631 These guys clearly understand that this battle is a
spiritual one at its root, and that action is needed. Many Christians,
even ones who firmly support and love Israel, believe that since
everything is ultimately in God&#8217;s hands anyway, there is no need for us
to take action. This position is wrong. If anything, the Bible teaches
us that God desires to accomplish His will through us. He has honored us
by inviting us to partner with Him, and we should not miss that
opportunity. If you are able, make every effort to be one of those
physically and publicly standing for Israel when later this month the
nations of the world again come against her to try and wrest control of
the most important and strategic parts of this land.</p>
