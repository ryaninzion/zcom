<div class="entry-content"><p>I have written on the issue of <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/1861.htm">Palestinian children being indoctrinated
to hate and fight Israel</a>
before, but the issue warrants rehashing in light of the new Hamas
children&#8217;s program until recently hosted by a Mickey Mouse look-alike.
To be sure, anti-Israel incitement in the Palestinian media and local
school curriculums is nothing new and is ongoing. Unfortunately, that
gross violation of the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s agreements with Israel is
rarely covered by an international press more interested in blaming
Israel for the Palestinians&#8217; problems. Homas, however, partially
remedied that problem when it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-c6lbFGC4">committed copyright infringement against
Disney</a>, thereby making the
indoctrination of Palestinian children headline news. The latest
development in this saga was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrieBhaGgHM">&#8220;martyrdom&#8221; of Farfur the
Mouse</a> earlier this month at
the hands of a man playing an Israeli security agent. In the clip,
Farfur is seen trying to peacefully argue his right as a Palestinian to
Jerusalem, which he accuses the Jews of conquering and stealing from his
people. Farfur&#8217;s recently announced replacement, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=pFz8DwvJP6Q">Nahool the
Bee</a>, is not prepared to be led
meekly to slaughter like his &#8220;cousin,&#8221; and tells his young audience in
the newest installment of _Tomorrow&#8217;s Pioneers_ that they must &#8220;take
revenge upon the enemies of Allah, the murderers of the prophets [a
common Islamic reference to the Jews]&#8230;until [Jerusalem] will be
liberated from their filth.&#8221; As a father, watching these clips hit me
hard. I often join my three-and-a-half-year-old son as he enjoys his
favorite programs on Israel&#8217;s popular children&#8217;s channel. Completely
innocent shows that make no reference whatsoever to the conflict around
us. It literally brings tears to my eyes when I then think that children
in my son&#8217;s same demographic in nearby Ramallah, Bethlehem, Hebron and
elsewhere are being taught by their favorite fuzzy characters to hate
and kill. It would devastate me if my son&#8217;s young mind was absorbing
such lessons. This is an issue that needs to really be brought front and
center. Israel, the US, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and everyone
else can negotiate and sign whatever pieces of paper they want, but as
long as Palestinian children are being taught to hate and kill, there
will be no peace. In fact, it is quite telling that official Palestinian
media and the Palestinian Authority school curriculums are teaching
children these things. It means they don&#8217;t see an end to the conflict in
whatever &#8220;final status&#8221; agreement they expect to soon conclude with
Israel. They want their future generations to be ready, mentally and
physically, to fight the Jews.</p>
