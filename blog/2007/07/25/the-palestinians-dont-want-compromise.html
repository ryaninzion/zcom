<div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli prime ministers are able to increase their public backing by
concluding even minor compromise agreements with the Arabs, but the
mainstream media and world leaders are 100% mistaken in asserting that
such deals provide long-term political traction for Palestinian leaders.
This misguided line of thinking featured once again in a _Ha&#8217;aretz_
story published on Wednesday regarding Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s
offer to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/886022.html">negotiate an &#8220;Agreement of Principles&#8221; toward the
establishment of a Palestinian
state</a> with PLO leader
Mahmoud Abbas. The leftist newspaper maintained that such an agreement,
which Israel hopes and assumes would be based on mutual compromise,
would &#8220;offer both Abbas and Olmert domestic political gains, and the
Palestinian leader will be able to use it as part of his reelection
campaign.&#8221; It is hard to understand why after more than a decade of the
&#8220;peace&#8221; process these guys still don&#8217;t get it. Abbas cannot go back to
the Palestinian public without 100% of their demands being met. It is
what he has been promising them for years, and it is what the
Palestinian education system is teaching Palestinian children must be
extracted from the &#8220;criminal and blood-thirsty Jews&#8221; <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/23/unchecked-abuse-of-palestinian-children">one way or
another</a>.
The Palestinians have been conditioned by their leadership to accept no
compromise, so you can be sure that same leadership will never conclude
the peace process without having all of its demands met in full. That is
precisely the reason Yasser Arafat turned down Ehud Barak&#8217;s final status
deal at Camp David in 2000. Arafat knew that the little bit of
compromise Barak was asking him to make would ultimately be unacceptable
to the Palestinians, and definitely would not help him in retaining his
dictatorial powers. Going down this path of folly, it seems the best
Israel can hope for is a bilateral agreement that does include some
degree of Palestinian compromise over the land, but which will without
doubt justify in the minds of the Palestinians a continuation of the
&#8220;resistance.&#8221; Israel will get its piece of paper, and the Palestinians
will get most of &#8220;their&#8221; land, but the attacks will continue. Abbas will
claim he is at peace with Israel, but that he simply cannot control or
contain the Hamas rogue in his midst. Arafat permitted the establishment
of Hamas for just such a purpose - so that he could pretend to be
engaged in meaningful peace talks with Israel, while anti-Jewish
Palestinian terrorism continued unabated. This is what Israel&#8217;s current
leadership and the international forces influencing it are offering
Israelis.</p>
