<div class="entry-content"><p>Resolutions introduced in both the US Senate and House of
Representatives this week <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2007/2/emw506178.htm">very belatedly recognizing that there was
once a Jewish refugee crisis in the Middle
East</a> are both
promising and dangerous. It is promising that a body with as much
influence as the US Congress is pushing the issue of the international
community&#8217;s need to address the fact that hundreds of thousands of Jews
were dispossessed and expelled by the Arab states they called home just
50-some years ago. But it is dangerous that Congress wants to tie that
to recognition of the &#8220;rights of Palestinian refugees.&#8221; There are some
glaring differences between the two cases: - The so-called
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; who were displaced during Israel&#8217;s War of Independence
for the most part did not move more than 20 miles, and still found
themselves surrounded by people sharing the same ethnicity, language,
culture and religion. To call them &#8220;refugees&#8221; is somewhat disingenuous,
to say the least. - The majority of displaced &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; became
displaced because <a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/issues/expulsion.html">their own leaders ordered them to get out of the
way</a> so the Jews
could be more easily finished off. Again, not &#8220;refugees,&#8221; but rather
members of the Arab &#8220;Ummah&#8221; who unfortunately found themselves having to
start over when their leaders and armies failed to defeat Israel. - The
Jews, on the other hand, were the defenseless minority in their host
nations, and were stripped of their possessions, persecuted and thrown
out by their Arab overlords, necessitating in many cases a long and
arduous journey to the only place they would be safe - the State of
Israel. Once there, they did share a religion with those around them,
but they had to adapt to a new culture and learn a new language in order
to survive. The very definition of refugees. These are all things that
need to be taken into consideration, but perhaps the most glaring
difference between the Jewish refugees from Arab state and the
&#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; is that the Jewish refugees were promptly
resettled. And not only that, they were promptly resettled by a nascent
state that didn&#8217;t really have the means to resettle them. The
&#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; meanwhile, have been forced to remain &#8220;refugees&#8221; by
their Arab brothers for 50+ years! Additionally, their children have
been labeled as refugees too! There is no precedent for this, no other
refugee situation that was ever dealt with by perpetuating the refugee
status of the displaced and actually transferring it to their children
and grandchildren. The only explanation can be that the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
refugee issue is <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/267">not really a refugee issue at
all</a>, but a cynical diplomatic
ploy to demonize the Jewish state and force it to allow its borders to
be flooded with Arab Muslims. This is what Congress needs to recognize
in its resolutions. The Jews long ago dealt with their own refugee
problem. Now it&#8217;s time for the Arabs to do the same - or admit that
there never was one to begin with. Congress&#8217; current course of action is
only going to further legitimize the myth of the &#8220;Palestinian refugee.&#8221;</p>
