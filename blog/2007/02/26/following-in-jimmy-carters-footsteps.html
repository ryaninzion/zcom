<div class="entry-content"><p>PeaNUT-job Jimmy Carter claims his <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3369679,00.html">truest and most heartfelt desire is
for Israel to live in
peace</a>, but
all he really cares about is getting the Israelis and Arabs to sign
another peace of worthless paper so he can cement his own legacy. Sadly,
Carter&#8217;s is the same path being tread by President George W. Bush, as it
was by Bill Clinton before him, and George Bush Sr. before him. Bush,
with his <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/268">messianic declarations about brining peace to the Middle
East</a> via his &#8220;two-state vision,&#8221;
certainly finds himself agreeing with Carter&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Israel
must exchange Palestinian land [sic] for peace.&#8221; That America&#8217;s leaders
failed to change their tune after Israel&#8217;s full surrender of the Gaza
Strip not only did not result in peace, but actually increased the
violence and led to Hamas&#8217; electoral victory should be proof enough that
their true goal is not peace, at least not for Israel. What concerns me
more, however, is the failure of Israel&#8217;s friends among the American
Christian community to unleash a hurricane of opposition to Bush&#8217;s plans
in the wake of this realization. I know people here and there are
writing to the White House, and there has been the occasional pro-Israel
rally (all of which I feel lacked real fire and passion.) But why don&#8217;t
Israel&#8217;s numerous friends in the US react to Bush&#8217;s policies regarding
the Holy Land in the same impassioned manner that the liberal Left
reacts to the war in Iraq? If Carter were still in office, I can imagine
a far greater mobilization of Christian opposition to his policies
vis-a-vis Israel. But Bush&#8217;s determined quest to play midwife to
&#8220;Palestine&#8221; is no less dangerous. In my view, it is Bush&#8217;s strong stand
against the America-hating Muslim &#8220;extremists&#8221; - which the president
wrongly identifies as a mere fringe element in the Islamic world - that
has kept the largely patriotic, America-loving Christian community from
focusing too much attention on his &#8220;Road Map to Israel&#8217;s demise.&#8221; I
don&#8217;t believe that Bush himself is evil, or has evil intentions. But
like so many Christians in America, I believe he is blinded to God&#8217;s
plans for Israel, and he is allowing his &#8220;war on terror&#8221; to be used by
the true, underlying Enemy to blunt what could be massive American
Christian support for and positive participation in that divine scheme.
I remember that just after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US an
American friend told my colleague <a href="http://www.stangoodenough.com/">Stan
Goodenough</a> that America&#8217;s Evangelicals
were still for Israel, but that we needed to back off on all the
pro-Israel stuff for a bit and let them deal with the assault on their
own nation. It is right to face down the demonic Islamofacist assault on
America, but not at the expense of remembering that Israel takes center
stage in God&#8217;s plans to defeat evil once and for all. If Americans are
allowing themselves to be made ineffective in the battle to prevent the
Enemy&#8217;s efforts to thwart God&#8217;s plans by dividing Israel, then their own
war on terror is ultimately pointless.</p>
