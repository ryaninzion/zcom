<div class="entry-content"><p>Senior Israeli defense officials and politicians are trying their best
to downplay talk of war with Syria in the coming year. But their words
tend to ring hollow amid the contrary assessments and Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert&#8217;s order to the IDF to <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1697">prepare for war just in
case</a>. Last week, a senior
military correspondent <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1689">suggested that war with Syria was almost a
certainty</a>, citing Damascus&#8217;
acquisition of new and improved missiles and air defenses and its
hostile redeployment of forces near the Golan Heights. Even more telling
was Olmert&#8217;s concern embodied in his announcement on Sunday that the IDF
must get ready for war, which he attempted to veil by claiming the order
was just a precautionary measure. Equally unreassuring was the testimony
of Israel&#8217;s Military Intelligence and Mossad chiefs, who both stated
that the likelihood of war with Syria this year was next to nothing, but
qualified that assessment by pointing out certain triggers that could
lead to war. According to both men, Israeli defensive moves deemed
hostile by the Arab world, a harsh Israeli response to Syrian-backed
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror, or a renewal of hostilities with Hezbollah could
all spark all-out war with Syria. I am not sure who these guys think
they are fooling (I hope they are not fooling themselves), but the
likelihood of **all three** of those things happening in the next 12
months is *very* high! Is Isaiah 17:1 about to be fulfilled? Certainly
Israel&#8217;s past conflicts with Syria sparked similar speculation, but
consider that in 1967 and 1973 the primary Syrian threat was from its
large armored forces conducting a slow ground assault against the
Galilee region. Today, the primary Syrian threat is from its long-range
missiles, which can kill huge numbers of Israelis in nearly every part
of the country in a very short period of time. The natural response to
Syria&#8217;s ground invasions of Israel was to push back their armor and
slowly advance into Syrian territory. The natural response to a chemical
warhead on Tel Aviv will be the utter destruction of Damascus. We appear
to be just one Hezbollah rocket barrage or large Islamic Jihad suicide
bombing away from that series of events unraveling before us.</p>
