<div class="entry-content"><p>Naturally, the Palestinian Authority and Gaza&#8217;s Hamas rulers want to
discredit the notion that Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al Qaeda terrorist network
has set up shop in the territories under their control, but their claims
simply are not compatible with the available evidence. Omedia did a
<a href="http://www.omedia.org/Show_Article.asp?DynamicContentID=2496&amp;MenuID=603&amp;ThreadID=1014010">recent
analysis</a>
showing fairly definitively that the Gaza-based Army of Islam terror
group is a local Al Qaeda branch, and that it is and has for years been
operating in the volatile coastal strip with the approval of first the
Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority and now Hamas. > In an interview
on the Ilaf website (July 17, 2007), Abu Ashour, the right-hand man of
Army of Islam leader Mamtuz Doghmush, said the organization “embraces
the principles in which Al Qaeda believes”&#8230; He noted Al Qaeda sends
money to finance the activity of the Army of Islam, as well as conveying
directives for action. Ashour believes “the decision to [BBC reporter]
kidnap Alan Johnston was made by Al Qaeda &#8216;on the outside&#8217; and the
decision to release him also arrived from &#8216;outside&#8217; in order to avoid
bloodshed.” > > Abu Ashour also revealed the Army of Islam was
established in the Gaza Strip 30 years ago. “At first the Afghans
arrived in order to spread religious awareness,” he said, referring to
Arab fighters who had fought in Afghanistan. “All the Afghans belonged
to Al Qaeda and we called them by their noms de guerre.” That the Army
of Islam operates in Gaza with the approval and even support of the
local rulers became evident last month when Hamas and the Al
Qaeda-linked group worked out a mutually beneficial deal culminating in
Johnston&#8217;s release. While the Army of Islam claims to have been
operating in Gaza for the past 30 years, its recent rise to prominence
is evidence that any territory surrendered by Israel to the Palestinians
will become a haven of global Islamic terrorism. Hamas is already too
entrenched in every area of Palestinian society, be it in Gaza or Judea
and Samaria. That much is clear following Hamas&#8217; landslide municipal and
parliamentary electoral victories over the past three years. Nor has
American backing proved effective is stopping Hamas&#8217; spread and eventual
takeover of areas handed to the Palestinian Authority. If the so-called
“West Bank” is given to the Palestinians, it will eventually be a Hamas
stronghold, just like Gaza. And once that area is in Hamas hands, it
will become a base of operations for Al Qaeda, a new headquarters from
which Osama bin Laden&#8217;s ilk can plan their assault on Judeo-Christian
civilization. Hamas and all the other Palestinian terror groups have
successfully convinced the world that they are not part of the global
Islamic jihad, and that their violence is directed solely against the
“Israeli occupation.” That is why the presence of Al Qaeda is so
detrimental to their current plans. What the Palestinians are trying to
hide is that they ultimately share the ideology being put into action by
Al Qaeda. > The Hamas movement is well aware of the growing power of
the Al Qaeda offshoot and is troubled by the fact that quite a few in
the Hamas military arm and even in its leadership have begun to embrace
the global outlook of Al Qaeda. Hamas members especially are devout
Muslims, and Islam teaches that they must subjugate the entire world,
that all unbelievers must come under Islamic rule via military conquest.
So it should be no surprise that elements within Hamas are starting to
openly embrace Al Qaeda. It&#8217;s no surprise, but it should serve as a
warning. These Hamas boys are just the beginning. Once the Palestinians
have what they want from Israel, they will turn on their benefactors in
the West.</p>
