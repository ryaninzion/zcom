<div class="entry-content"><p>Mainstream support in the US and Europe for the global war on terror is
still fairly easy to come by when the enemy is a rogue, independent
group like Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al Qaeda. It becomes more of a challenge
when dealing with groups like Lebanon&#8217;s Hizballah and the Palestinian
movement Hamas. Both Hizballah and Hamas are recognized by most
governments in the West as terrorist organizations. Nevertheless, many
of those same Western governments today advocate engaging the groups in
dialogue due to the fact that both are also involved in local
government. The two primary arguments for that position are: 1.
Hizballah and Hamas (and other similar groups) are an inescapable
reality and integral part of their respective societies that cannot be
ignored; 2. Unlike Al Qaeda, Hizballah and Hamas are localized
resistance movements, despite their frequent verbal identification with
a global Islamic outlook. The first argument is a cop-out by nations
that either are wary of sparking a clash of civilizations they refuse to
believe is already in full swing, or are too afraid of afraid of their
own Muslim minorities to be seen siding with a non-Muslim entity against
Muslim groups. Hizballah and Hamas have become integral parts of their
respective societies precisely because the dominant powers that be have
refused to make it clear that support for such groups is unacceptable.
And I don&#8217;t mean by merely placing these groups on lists of recognized
terrorist organizations. I mean by making the populations that harbor
and support them really _feel_ that they are paying too high a price
for doing so. The second argument sets an extremely dangerous precedent
that can only lead to the perpetuation of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
Hizballah and Hamas are on Western lists of recognized terrorist
organizations because they engage in tactics that are terrorist in
nature in order to achieve their political goals. Granting them any
degree of legitimacy will only encourage Hizballah, Hamas and other
“resistance movements” around the world to continue committing
atrocities so long as their underlying cause is acceptable to the
international community. Take as an example a recent report that the
United Nations is favorably considering a Lebanese proposal to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1187502427231&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">redraw
the Israel-Lebanon
border</a>
in accordance with Lebanese and Hizballah demands in order to avoid
future conflict. The international community is critical of Hizballah&#8217;s
assault on northern Israel that led to last summer&#8217;s war, but is now
signaling that it accepts Lebanon&#8217;s claim that a small piece of the
Golan Heights controlled by Israel is in fact Lebanese territory, which
was Hizballah&#8217;s justification for attacking in the first place. When all
is said and done, Hizballah is going to brush off the international
community&#8217;s anger over its tactics and hold up as a prize the fact that
its assault on Israel led to the UN reversing an earlier decision in
order to meet its demands. And that is going to provide enormous
encouragement to every terrorist organization everywhere that is
employing terrorist violence to achieve political gains.</p>
