<div class="entry-content"><p>The Israeli and international medias are abuzz with reports out of
Hebron regarding yesterday&#8217;s forced removal of two Jewish families from
an old wholesale market building they took over outside of the tiny
defined Jewish area of the biblical town. Nearly every report I have
read makes it sound as though these families invaded an active market
and evicted the poor Arabs who were trying to do business there. The
truth, however, is that this particular market has been abandoned for
over 13 years. The Jewish families in question moved into an empty
building adjacent to the present-day Avraham Aveinu neighborhood. Nor is
it the first time the Hebron Jewish community has attempted to occupy
the market. Several Jewish families moved into the building in 2004,
only to be forcibly removed by the government of Ariel Sharon. Why do
these Jews keep trying to take up residence in what is dilapidated and
probably very unsanitary old building? <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/4260.htm">Because it belongs to
them</a>. And that is the
other part of the story that the mainstream media is ignoring. The land
under that market was part of the original Avraham Aveinu neighborhood,
an area of Hebron that had been home to Jews from ancient times right up
until 1929, when Hebron&#8217;s Arabs massacred many of the neighborhood&#8217;s
residents in the most brutal manner. Most are aware that the British
rulers of the area then evacuated the rest of Hebron&#8217;s Jews “for their
own safety,” but failed to prevent the town&#8217;s Arabs from taking over
their property. These properties were originally Jewish owned, and were
stolen by the Arabs after they had violently removed the Jews from their
midst. But leave it those arrogant Arab criminals to not bother to alter
the property registrations, secure in the knowledge that the
international community would always take their side against the Jews
(remember, this was right before the start of the Nazi Holocaust, when
global hatred of the Jews was at a peak). Amazingly, the property in
this part of Hebron was still registered to its original Jewish owners
when Jordan illegally occupied the area in 1948. And Jordan didn&#8217;t
bother to change the records, either! The Jordanians simply listed the
property under the Custodian for Enemy Property, a label Israel
shockingly continues to apply to the real estate in question. Leave it
to the media to omit the most important portions of historical context
surrounding such a story. For more information on the 1929 massacre of
Hebron&#8217;s ancient Jewish community, visit the <a href="http://www.hebron.com/english/articles.php?cat_id=102">website of the
reconstituted Hebron Jewish
Community</a>.</p>
