<div class="entry-content"><p>The Evangelical Christian community in Israel is abuzz this week after
learning that a well liked and widely respected Christian couple who
have been living in the Land for 20 years have been <a href="http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/214837.aspx">told to
leave</a>. Ron and Carol Cantrell
spent years working at the Christian humanitarian outreach <a href="http://www.bridgesforpeace.org/">Bridges for
Peace</a> and operated their own ministry,
<a href="http://www.shalom-shalom-jerusalem.org/">Shalom Shalom Jerusalem</a>, with
the aim of educating the Christian world regarding Israel&#8217;s central
importance in God&#8217;s plan of global redemption. Two of the Cantrell
children are today married to Israelis and will be remaining here, which
explains Ron and Carol&#8217;s decision to not fight the Ministry of Interior
ruling and possibly be blacklisted from ever entering the country even
to visit future grandchildren. The news was most troubling to many of us
Christian Zionists here in Israel because the Cantrells had given up a
far more comfortable life in America in order to serve the Lord in
Israel and defend the Jewish state, and that at a time when a record
number of Israelis are themselves trying to move to the US. Not only
that, Ron was actually in a suicide bomb attack in 2003 in downtown
Jerusalem. He was unhurt outside of a few scratches, but was a direct
witness to the gruesome slaughter of 17 people and the maiming of
another 70. Despite experiencing the dire security situation first hand,
Ron and Carol&#8217;s determination to remain planted in Israel only grew
stronger. These are the very kind of people Isaiah (14:1) speaks of: >
The Lord will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel
and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite
with the house of Jacob. And that is why I believe they are being
targeted, and why others will also be forced to leave, barring the
Lord&#8217;s intervention. It is easy to criticize the Israeli government for
kicking out sincere people dedicated to this nation at a time when many
Israelis themselves just want to leave, and that criticism is justified.
However, there is a spiritual element here. It is telling that die-hard
Christian Zionists who are recognized by many Israelis as the only truly
dedicated allies they have in the world are being targeted for
deportation, when groups such as the Scientologists and other New Age
movements are <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3437443,00.html">actively brainwashing Israeli
children</a>
with messages that run absolutely contrary to God&#8217;s Word and Judaism.
The enemy wants the allies God Himself has provided for Israel out,
while groups teaching alternative “truths” are allowed to prosper. The
true enemy here is _the_ Enemy, not the Israeli authorities. Pray that
the Israelis will begin to have their eyes opened to this deception
sooner rather than later.</p>
