<div class="entry-content"><p>The peripheral left-wing Christian group Churches for Middle East Peace
(CMEP) is calling on American Christians to reclaim what it calls
“Christian values” by siding with its un-biblical policy of pressuring
the US government to more rapidly implement the division of the Land of
Israel. Ignoring polls that show the vast majority of Americans side
with the Christian Zionist view that <a href="http://uspolitics.tribe.net/thread/54bafe2c-e44e-48d2-80cc-3a45c36863a7">a Palestinian state should not be
created on Israel&#8217;s ancient
heartland</a>,
CMEP claims to represent the sensibilities of mainstream Christianity in
America. In a <a href="http://www.commongroundnews.org/article.php?id=21511&amp;lan=en&amp;sid=0&amp;sp=0">recent
editorial</a>,
CMEP Executive Director Corinne Whitlatch lists as the first concern
American Christians have regarding the Middle East conflict the fact
that Bethlehem has been cut off from Jerusalem by Israel&#8217;s security
barrier. Of course, she fails to note that the barrier was only made
necessary because the Palestinian Muslims in Bethlehem just couldn&#8217;t
stop killing Jesus&#8217; Jewish brethren. Whitlatch is also wrong to list
that as the primary concern most American Christians have when examining
the conflict and America&#8217;s role in it. Most Christians in the US are
more concerned that their own government is playing midwife to the birth
of Palestine, which flies in the face of every prophecy regarding the
return of the Children of Israel to their God-given land. The Lord has
promised to deal harshly with the nations that try to divide His land,
so I am pretty sure most American Christians are worried about that, and
not about the inability of Palestinian Arabs to cross more easily from
Bethlehem to Jerusalem. Whitlatch goes on to justify highlighting such a
relatively trivial matter by demonizing Christian Zionists as a radical
fringe movement, and our views as unacceptable to the mainstream. She
claims that there is some giant phantom majority of Christians who are
all for dividing the Land of Israel in the name of justice, but that
they are simply ignored by the media. > News reports of Christians
demonstrating passionate and exclusive support for Israel&#8230;are known
throughout the Arab and Muslim world. These reports distort the reality
of American Christian sentiment. Regrettably, the moderate peace and
justice language and actions of traditional churches are rarely
considered newsworthy, making these voices within the Christian
community rarely heard. We all know that to be false since just this
month a letter signed by a mere 30 Christian leaders supporting the
creation of a Palestinian Arab state made headlines in none other than
the _New York Times_. Christians who hold these un-biblical views are
not ignored by the press, there just aren&#8217;t as many of them as CMEP
would like to believe. Whitlatch goes on to assert that it is the
“Israeli occupation” that is causing the recent exodus of Palestinian
Christians, and she is pushing Christian members of Congress to act
against this. How such a ludicrous position can be tolerated, I do not
know. If the “Israeli occupation” is causing this exodus, then why
didn&#8217;t all the Palestinian Christians flee 30 years ago when the
so-called “occupation” first began? The fact is that Bethlehem was a
thriving Christian town right up until the time when Israel handed it
over to Palestinian Muslim rule! Whitlatch repeatedly references the
“Israeli occupation” as a major cause of the ongoing conflict, but fails
to mention Palestinian Islamic terrorism even one time. She criticizes
Congress for failing to be a good friend to both Israel and the
Palestinians, but ignores the fact that it is difficult for a society
that rejects terror to befriend one that embraces it. Though I am sure
Whitlatch is someone who would grant Palestinian terrorism the status of
legitimate resistance. So CMEP is all about reconciliation, justice and
peace in the Middle East, so long as it comes at Israel&#8217;s expense and
those pesky Bible passages about not dividing the land are not brought
up. Peace and justice are indeed biblical and Christian values, but only
when they are implemented in a way that accomplishes God&#8217;s Will as
outlined in the Bible. When peace and justice are implemented in
according to modern liberal humanist standards, they do not represent
biblical Christian values.</p>
