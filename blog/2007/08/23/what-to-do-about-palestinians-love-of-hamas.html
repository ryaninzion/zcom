<div class="entry-content"><p>The results of yet another Palestinian opinion poll show that a very
sizable portion of that public would still vote Hamas if elections were
held today. Many commentators and Western leaders say that means Hamas
is an inescapable reality and must be engaged, not isolated. They are
wrong. Conducted by the Jerusalem Media Communications Center, the poll
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/896435.html">showed</a> that if
leadership elections were held today, current “president” Mahmoud Abbas
would receive 20.6 percent of the vote, while Hamas Prime Minister
Ismail Haniyeh would be chosen by 18.8 percent of the public. Clearly,
the year-long diplomatic and economic isolation of the Hamas government
has not convinced many Palestinians to reconsider their choice of
leaders. A lot of liberals, including the leaders of many European
countries, will point to that fact as evidence that, like it or not,
Hamas is part of the Palestinian landscape and must be accepted as such.
But the correct answer is not to accept Hamas and hope to moderate its
policies through pointless talks. Hamas became popular primarily because
of its successful execution of terrorist violence against Israel, and it
is not going to renounce the very tactic that brought it to power. The
correct answer is to reeducate the Palestinians. Following World War II,
there were a lot of Germans and Japanese who still sympathized and
agreed with the policies of the Nazis and the imperial regime in Tokyo.
The US and its allies did not throw up their hands and just accept that
fact. No, they implemented stringent reeducation programs that have
today resulted in Germany and Japan being two of the most unlikely
nations to start a war. As part of the “Oslo” peace accords, the
Palestinian Authority was supposed to reeducate the Arabs under its
jurisdiction in the same way. But that was where the Western powers that
oversaw the peace process departed from the wisdom of their predecessors
- they put responsibility for the reeducation in the hands of those who
needed to be reeducated. As a result, most Palestinians today see
violence against Israel as a legitimate negotiating tactic and will vote
for the group that can most successfully kill Jews and score perceived
military victories.</p>
