<div class="entry-content"><p>Like many others, I was initially shocked when I read last week that US
intelligence had determined with &#8220;moderate confidence&#8221; that Iran
abandoned its quest for nuclear weapons in 2003. Hadn&#8217;t US intelligence
determined just 11 months earlier with a far greater degree of
confidence that Iran was determined, despite the potential consequences,
to develop nuclear military power? From the <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/inr/rls/79065.htm">US Annual Threat
Assessment</a> delivered on
January 11, 2007: > We assess that Tehran is determined to develop
nuclear weapons&#8211;despite its international obligations and international
pressure. But then I began to process this development in the context of
the rest of the news surrounding it. Like his father and Bill Clinton
before him, President George W. Bush is determined to carve out for
himself a positive legacy before the end of his presidency. Mr. Bush
can&#8217;t do that if his second terms ends with the entire Muslim world
hating him. And while there is little hope of convincing the Muslim
world to suddenly love America, let alone the Bush Administration, there
is no hope whatsoever of that happening if Israel strikes Iran with
tacit US approval. Israeli leaders responded to the US intelligence
report by stressing that Israeli intelligence did not concur with the
conclusions, and that Israel would still strike Iran if it felt there
was no other option. But an Israel cabinet minister <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=37147">told <em>Time</em>
magazine</a> what everyone knows to
be true: that the US report had effectively taken the option of a
preemptive Israeli strike off the table, since Israel did not intend to
attack Iran without the green light the Olmert government believes it
needs from Washington. In addition to that, I believe, as do others I
have spoken to, that the findings of this report are part of the overall
scheme to divide the Land of Israel. Again, like his father and Bill
Clinton before him, the creation of a Palestinian Arab state would be
the jewel in the crown Bush hopes will be his legacy. Bush declared with
messianic vigor in 2004 that he would be the one to <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/268">bring peace to the
Middle East</a>, and he is determined
to see that pledge through. However, Mr. Bush only has one year left to
get things done, and we are no further along in the &#8220;peace&#8221; process
today than we were 10 years ago. How in the world could this situation
possibly be brought to a head in just one year? Well, it certainly won&#8217;t
if there are other major regional concerns, like a nuclear Iran. So the
US took that concern off the table in order to focus maximum attention
on ramming through the division of the Land of Israel. If you ask me,
Bush and Rice are not to be believed when they express frustration over
the findings of the intelligence report. This is all part of the plan.
<a href="http://www.stangoodenough.com/?p=94">Stan has written a must-read analysis of this
situation</a>, explaining how the US
intelligence report is only the latest piece of evidence that in the
end, Israel will stand alone with no national friends or allies.</p>
