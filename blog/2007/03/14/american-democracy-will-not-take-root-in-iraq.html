<div class="entry-content"><p>US strategy in Iraq is based on the mistaken assumption that Arab
Islamic culture is fertile ground for American-style democracy. But has
that form of democracy ever been successful in the Middle East? It
hasn&#8217;t worked in Egypt and Syria, nation&#8217;s that pretend to be democratic
and send their people to the polls, only to ensure that the reigning
dictator always receives at least 90% of the vote. It hasn&#8217;t worked in
Lebanon, where terror bosses fill many of the parliament&#8217;s seats and
even ministerial positions, and order their own forces to violently
oppose government policy when it does not mesh with their own. The same
can be said of the Palestinian Authority, which last year did hold
actual democratic elections. The Palestinian Arabs were given an
opportunity to democratically elect their representatives, and they
overwhelmingly voted for the most blood-soaked terrorists among them.
The only &#8220;good&#8221; example of democracy in the Middle East is Jordan, and
it only works there because ultimately a monarch holds the reins of
power. So why believe that a fractious Iraq will be any different? Why
will that nation suddenly be the one Islamic state that will become a
mirror of American and European democracy? The answer is that it won&#8217;t.
Looking at Iraq, we need to consider why there is more bloodshed and
insurgency today when democracy and political freedom are being given a
chance than there was during the authoritarian rule of Saddam Hussein.
What needs to be remembered is that Arab Islamic culture is based on a
tribal system that still very much influences daily life in the region.
In that tribal system, perception is everything, and whoever is
perceived as being the strongest will be accepted as leader, even if
they are hated. Furthermore, Islam itself encompasses both personal
faith and political governance. It dictates how a majority-Muslim nation
is to be run. In the case of Iraq, Saddam Hussein faced less insurgency
and rebellion than today&#8217;s democratic government because he was
recognized as the dominant, if not stabilizing, power within the
country. The same is true when comparing Syria and Jordan to Lebanon.
Syria and Jordan have experienced relatively few uprisings because the
regimes are powerful and have demonstrated their willingness to use
excessive force to put down any threat to their rule. Lebanon, however,
has suffered decades of sectarian violence at least in part because
efforts to maintain a Western-style democracy has created a central
government that is both less powerful and less willing to use excessive
force than the various other armed forces that roam the country. The
Palestinian Authority is now experiencing a similar fate because of the
decision to let the people vote for who they perceived to be the
strongest, and therefore the best leaders. Over the past decade, Hamas
has managed to create a perception of itself as powerful enough to do
damage to the Palestinian Arabs&#8217; greatest enemy - Israel. The group was
and is viewed as the strongest among that society because of its
unrepentant willingness to employ brutal violence against both external
and internal enemies, unlike the PLO which, at least on the surface,
pretends to follow a more Western-style of diplomacy and dialogue. The
fact of the matter is that Arab Islamic culture is not fertile ground
for American-style democracy. As I see it, America has two choices in
Iraq: 1. Drop the idea of American-style democracy and instead implement
a form a representative government that works in tandem and is at least
partially subordinate to a strong central leadership that wields
ultimate military power. This solution would probably require dividing
Iraq along its more natural ethnic lines. 2. Realize that the only way
to turn an authoritarian society into a truly democratic one is to
implement a far more heavy-handed and drawn out occupation with the aim
of completely reeducating the population. This is precisely how Japan
was transformed, over a period of many years, from a society that would
sacrifice everything to expand the domains of its god-like emperor to
one that now fully embraces the ideals of American democracy.</p>
