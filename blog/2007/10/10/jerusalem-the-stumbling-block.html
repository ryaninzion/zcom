<div class="entry-content"><p>The international community will bring the Israelis and Arabs together
in Annapolis, Maryland next month to again try to solve the Middle East
conflict according to its own wisdom and humanist agenda. It will fail,
as it has every other time, and it looks like Jerusalem will once again
be the stumbling block that prevents any real progress down the false
path to peace. Israel&#8217;s deputy prime minister is openly admitting that
the <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3457214,00.html">division of Jerusalem will be on the
table</a> at the
upcoming summit. Even Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, once the mayor of what
he insisted would always be the &#8220;eternal, undivided capital&#8221; of the
Jewish people, seems to be backing that position. But rather than jump
on the offer and then work to get more later, the Palestinians are
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257255317&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">hardening their
positions</a>
before negotiations have even began, making demands that would
necessitate uprooting well over 100,000 Jews from densely populated
neighborhoods - a concession the Palestinians know full well Olmert is
simply in no position to make. Why would they do this? Why would the
Palestinians make demands they know it is impossible for Olmert to meet,
instead of taking everything he is offering now and then demanding more
later? The Palestinians and the backers of their cause claim that offers
that do not meet 100% of their demands cannot be accepted because doing
so would prevent them from ever reaching their full goals. I would like
to note that in 1993, Yasser Arafat and his PLO ostensibly renounced the
use of terrorist violence against Israel and recognized the right of the
Jewish state to exist. That, however, clearly did not stop Arafat and
his Palestinians from employing terrorist violence against Israel and
seeking Jewish state&#8217;s ultimate demographic demise through a
&#8220;Palestinian right of return.&#8221; So why now would accepting most of
eastern Jerusalem prevent the Palestinians from continuing their
&#8220;struggle&#8221; to ultimately wrest control of all Jerusalem from the Jews?
Arafat also seemed to be stricken by this lack of logic when in 2000 he
turned down Ehud Barak&#8217;s offer of about 95 percent of Judea and Samaria,
including the eastern half of Jerusalem. This was the same Arafat who
knew in 1993 that he could sign deals with Israel and then not live up
to his side of the bargain, while retaining the support of the world for
future concessions. Something or someone muddled Arafat&#8217;s thinking in
2000, just as Abbas&#8217; is being muddled now. To me, it is clear that the
Lord is hardening the hearts of Israel&#8217;s enemies to prevent the world
and Israel&#8217;s own delusional leaders from going too far down this path of
destruction. That should come as no surprise to those who read and
believe the Bible. Zechariah 12 states that in these days Jerusalem will
be made a stumbling block, an immovable stone to all the nations that
try to move it, a hindrance to their plans. Expect the Annapolis summit
to fail (even if the leaders make some kind of &#8220;feel good&#8221; statement at
its closing), and expect Jerusalem to be the reason. Other good takes on
the planned division of Jerusalem: <a href="http://muqata.blogspot.com/2007/10/jerusalem-who-is-real-mother.html">Jameel over at the
Muqata</a>
notes that in the Bible, the mother who was willing to divide the baby
she claimed as hers was revealed by Solomon to not be the true mother.
<a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/10/pa-willingly-cedes-control-of-jerusalem.html">The Elder of
Zion</a>
points to an Arab report that the Palestinians are willing to put
Jerusalem under Jordanian sovereignty - kind of a &#8220;if we can&#8217;t have it,
then neither can the Jews&#8221; move. However, if the Palestinians are so
ready to let the Jordanians come in, is Jerusalem really as important to
them as they claim?</p>
