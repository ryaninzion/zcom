<div class="entry-content"><p>Former Israeli Knesset Member and Minister of Justice Tommy Lapid argued
persuasively, but erroneously in a recent <em>Jerusalem Post</em> op-ed that
both Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu
are right in their contrasting approaches to the peace process. Olmert
knows that he must at least try to engage the Arabs in dialogue, and
wean his nation off the belief that all the dreams, hopes and prayers of
generations of Jews can be fulfilled in the midst of the present
conflict, wrote Lapid. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Netanyahu is wrong to warn
of the dangers inherent in Olmert&#8217;s course of action. If the weak and
seemingly incapable regime of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud
Abbas, with whom Olmert is negotiating the surrender of the West Bank,
is again defeated by Hamas as it was in Gaza, &#8220;not only Tel Aviv&#8230;will
share the fate of Sderot, but so will Ben-Gurion Airport, cutting off
Israel&#8217;s ties with the world,&#8221; Lapid conceded. Israel, Lapid concluded,
simply has no choice but to soldier on along this path of disparate
political approaches, as &#8220;there is no practical solution to the conflict
in sight. &#8230;Some situations have no solutions. And for the time being,
life goes on.&#8221; That conclusion sounds reasonable, if not bleak, on the
surface, but falls apart if we dig a little deeper. Lapid fails to
entertain the option of one side in this equation - either the right led
by Netanyahu, or the left led by Olmert - waking up to reality and
backing the other&#8217;s position. While it is unlikely to happen, examining
the consequences of such an occurrence shows precisely why both sides
are not right. If, as Lapid accepts, Netanyahu is correct in his current
assertion that true and lasting peace cannot be made with the Abbas-led
Palestinian Authority regardless of how much Israel gives, then for
Netanyahu and the bulk of his followers to adopt Olmert&#8217;s position would
lead to catastrophe. However, for Olmert and the left to adopt
Netanyahu&#8217;s position would signal a seismic shift in an increasingly
pointless diplomatic process that has produced plenty of photo
opportunities and little peace since its inception more than a decade
ago. Lapid suggests that the right&#8217;s alternative to Olmert actively
pursuing doomed land-for-peace negotiations with the Palestinians is to
create a diplomatic vacuum, to more or less ignore the issue all
together. Lapid is right that such a scenario would invite &#8220;pressures
that we would find it impossible to withstand.&#8221; But Lapid is wrong in
thinking that the right&#8217;s substitute for offering strategic concessions
to an intractable foe is diplomatic idleness. Netanyahu has long
insisted that it is his desire to find a truly workable solution to the
conflict, and one of the right&#8217;s more active members in this arena,
National Union Party chief Rabbi Benny Elon, just launched a thoroughly
detailed alternative peace plan of his own. The ideas being put forth by
the right might not result in bilateral peace, but for the nation at
large to embrace them would signal to the world that Jewish history and
Israeli security are no longer being offered as sacrifices on the alter
of a false peace. And that would restore national pride, dignity and a
willingness to fight for Israel&#8217;s rights to levels that have not been
seen since the early years of the Jewish state&#8217;s rebirth. Lapid and
others on the left see the right&#8217;s alternatives as little more than hot
air because Israelis have been trained over the past decade by an
idealistic peace movement to view such proposals as wildly unrealistic.
How many times over the past three years alone have we heard Olmert and
Ariel Sharon before him lament that holding on to the full Zionist dream
has become an unfeasible and even irrational notion? The truth is that
the concept of land-for-peace has become unrealistic, just as the
insistence that this is a purely political and nationalistic struggle
that has nothing to do with religion has become untenable. The lesson
Israelis should have learned over the past decade as a result of
continued Palestinian intransigence and Hamas gains is that concessions
and goodwill are clearly not going to lead to peace, and offering them
will only embolden an enemy that has no intention of relinquishing its
quest to ultimately regain all that was once under Islam&#8217;s dominion.
Lapid is right in seeing no practical solution to the conflict. He is
wrong in thinking that Israel has no choice but to go along with this
moribund process anyway, to the detriment of its own cause and the well
being of its citizens.</p>
