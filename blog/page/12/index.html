  <div class="entry-content"><p>Senior Israeli defense officials and politicians are trying their best
to downplay talk of war with Syria in the coming year. But their words
tend to ring hollow amid the contrary assessments and Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert&#8217;s order to the IDF to <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1697">prepare for war just in
case</a>. Last week, a senior
military correspondent <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1689">suggested that war with Syria was almost a
certainty</a>, citing Damascus&#8217;
acquisition of new and improved missiles and air defenses and its
hostile redeployment of forces near the Golan Heights. Even more telling
was Olmert&#8217;s concern embodied in his announcement on Sunday that the IDF
must get ready for war, which he attempted to veil by claiming the order
was just a precautionary measure. Equally unreassuring was the testimony
of Israel&#8217;s Military Intelligence and Mossad chiefs, who both stated
that the likelihood of war with Syria this year was next to nothing, but
qualified that assessment by pointing out certain triggers that could
lead to war. According to both men, Israeli defensive moves deemed
hostile by the Arab world, a harsh Israeli response to Syrian-backed
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror, or a renewal of hostilities with Hezbollah could
all spark all-out war with Syria. I am not sure who these guys think
they are fooling (I hope they are not fooling themselves), but the
likelihood of **all three** of those things happening in the next 12
months is *very* high! Is Isaiah 17:1 about to be fulfilled? Certainly
Israel&#8217;s past conflicts with Syria sparked similar speculation, but
consider that in 1967 and 1973 the primary Syrian threat was from its
large armored forces conducting a slow ground assault against the
Galilee region. Today, the primary Syrian threat is from its long-range
missiles, which can kill huge numbers of Israelis in nearly every part
of the country in a very short period of time. The natural response to
Syria&#8217;s ground invasions of Israel was to push back their armor and
slowly advance into Syrian territory. The natural response to a chemical
warhead on Tel Aviv will be the utter destruction of Damascus. We appear
to be just one Hezbollah rocket barrage or large Islamic Jihad suicide
bombing away from that series of events unraveling before us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do genuinely feel for those of Middle Eastern descent who would not
harm a fly, but are still subjected to certain forms of discrimination
as a result of what their fellow Arabs are doing around the world. But
the simple fact remains that the enormous majority of terrorist actions
in the world today are being perpetrated by Muslims of Middle Eastern
descent. To not racially profile this group of people, even to the minor
inconvenience of the truly innocent ones, is just stupid. Up until now,
Israel has avoided participating in that particular form of stupidity.
Leave it to Olmert to put an end to that. In his unassailable knowledge
of what is best for Israel, Olmert this week ordered the Transportation
Ministry to <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3368739,00.html">ease security inspections of Arabs traveling through
Israel&#8217;s
airports</a>.
Certainly Olmert does not need to be reminded of how many times in
recent years Israeli Arabs, and not just &#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; have been
involved in acts of terrorism against the Jewish state. And there could
be no more juicy target for those killers than to bring down or hijack
Jew-filled airliners. Until now, Israel, despite being such a major
target for the jihadis, has had a stellar record of dealing with threats
against its airports precisely because it racially profiles the one
group capable of such attacks, rather than expending its resources
inspecting everyone equally. If Olmert&#8217;s new directive is not reversed
via pressure or the downfall of the government, I think we can expect to
see a hijacking or other major terror attack at an Israeli airport very
soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday demonstrated that he is
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3368104,00.html">not completely
dense</a> when
it comes to the true intentions of the Palestinian Arabs. Speaking at a
gathering of foreign journalists in Jerusalem, Olmert offered this gem:
> &#8220;The fact is that indeed the majority among the Palestinians voted
for people who don&#8217;t want to make peace with Israel, and without a
change among the Palestinians it will be very difficult to accomplish
this.&#8221; Unfortunately, he immediately slipped right back into the role of

greatest desire to give away the Jews&#8217; biblical heartland to these very
same peace-hating &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Resolutions introduced in both the US Senate and House of
Representatives this week <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2007/2/emw506178.htm">very belatedly recognizing that there was
once a Jewish refugee crisis in the Middle
East</a> are both
promising and dangerous. It is promising that a body with as much
influence as the US Congress is pushing the issue of the international
community&#8217;s need to address the fact that hundreds of thousands of Jews
were dispossessed and expelled by the Arab states they called home just
50-some years ago. But it is dangerous that Congress wants to tie that
to recognition of the &#8220;rights of Palestinian refugees.&#8221; There are some
glaring differences between the two cases: - The so-called
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; who were displaced during Israel&#8217;s War of Independence
for the most part did not move more than 20 miles, and still found
themselves surrounded by people sharing the same ethnicity, language,
culture and religion. To call them &#8220;refugees&#8221; is somewhat disingenuous,
to say the least. - The majority of displaced &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; became
displaced because <a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/issues/expulsion.html">their own leaders ordered them to get out of the
way</a> so the Jews
could be more easily finished off. Again, not &#8220;refugees,&#8221; but rather
members of the Arab &#8220;Ummah&#8221; who unfortunately found themselves having to
start over when their leaders and armies failed to defeat Israel. - The
Jews, on the other hand, were the defenseless minority in their host
nations, and were stripped of their possessions, persecuted and thrown
out by their Arab overlords, necessitating in many cases a long and
arduous journey to the only place they would be safe - the State of
Israel. Once there, they did share a religion with those around them,
but they had to adapt to a new culture and learn a new language in order
to survive. The very definition of refugees. These are all things that
need to be taken into consideration, but perhaps the most glaring
difference between the Jewish refugees from Arab state and the
&#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; is that the Jewish refugees were promptly
resettled. And not only that, they were promptly resettled by a nascent
state that didn&#8217;t really have the means to resettle them. The
&#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; meanwhile, have been forced to remain &#8220;refugees&#8221; by
their Arab brothers for 50+ years! Additionally, their children have
been labeled as refugees too! There is no precedent for this, no other
refugee situation that was ever dealt with by perpetuating the refugee
status of the displaced and actually transferring it to their children
and grandchildren. The only explanation can be that the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
refugee issue is <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/267">not really a refugee issue at
all</a>, but a cynical diplomatic
ploy to demonize the Jewish state and force it to allow its borders to
be flooded with Arab Muslims. This is what Congress needs to recognize
in its resolutions. The Jews long ago dealt with their own refugee
problem. Now it&#8217;s time for the Arabs to do the same - or admit that
there never was one to begin with. Congress&#8217; current course of action is
only going to further legitimize the myth of the &#8220;Palestinian refugee.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>West Bank Mama has a take on yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://westbankmama.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/the-missing-piece-is-the-ruler-of-the-world/">thwarted Tel Aviv suicide
bombing</a>
that is, with typical disregard for the divine, being ignored by the
rest of the media. One of the most frustrating aspects of living in
Israel is watching so many of the Israelis (the vast majority, I would
say) totally disregard the hand of the Almighty in the defense of their
nation. Conventional wisdom in Israel, especially among the ruling
elite, is that Israel is in and of itself a mighty military force with
no true rival in the region. So few stop to consider how in the world
such a tiny nation with so few people and natural resources became so
mighty as to be able to defeat the combined forces of much larger
nations. Or how about the Israelis&#8217; uncanny ability to prevent so many
of the terrorist attacks planned against them? Why are the well-funded,
heavily-armed and internationally-backed &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists not
able to carry out attacks on Israel with nearly the same frequency or
destructive power as the globally-shunned militants in Iraq? It can&#8217;t be
that the IDF and Shin Bet are *that* much better than the US military.
Someone Else must be playing a **big** role in Israel&#8217;s defense; it
just doesn&#8217;t make sense otherwise. And it is a shame that more Israelis
don&#8217;t see this. But they will. A day is coming that the strength of
their own arms will fail (we started to see this already with the
debacle in Lebanon last summer), and the nation will see and understand
Who it is that defends them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At least not when it comes to demonizing Israel. I know I should not be
surprised, but sometimes the audacity of the UN still causes me to lose
some coffee through my nose. It happened again yesterday when I read
that the UN anti-racism panel had met in a special session to <a href="http://www.yourish.com/2007/02/19/2766">question
Israel over whether or not it protects the holy sites of religions other
than Judaism</a>. This is just
totally unbelievable. There are mosques, churches and New Age centers
scattered throughout this country, not to mention the central shrine of
the Bahai faith in Haifa. And those are just the modern places of
worship. What does the UN think all those millions of Christian pilgrims
do when they come here every year? They visit Christian holy sites that
are not only protected for that purpose, but are usually fixed up real
pretty by the Israelis for their non-Jewish guests. The hypocrisy of the
UN simply knows no bounds. Where was this stupid panel when the Muslims
were destroying centuries worth of Jewish religious artifacts underneath
the Temple Mount a few years ago? Where was this panel when Palestinian
Arab mobs were <a href="http://www.geocities.com/m_yericho/jericho.htm">destroying an ancient synagogue in
Jericho</a> or the burial
site of <a href="http://the-american-israeli-patriot.blogspot.com/2007/02/remembering-josephs-tomb.html">one of Israel&#8217;s most revered
patriarchs</a>
in Shechem? Where were they when <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/597">tens of synagogues were burned to the
ground</a> in Gaza in the summer of
2005? And where are these UN hypocrites every time Saudi Arabia forbids
a Christian from <a href="http://righttruth.typepad.com/right_truth/2006/12/stewardess_bann.html">carrying a Bible into the
country</a>,
or <a href="http://www.domini.org/openbook/sau20010719.htm">tortures its own
people</a> for becoming
believers in Jesus? The examples could go on and on, but I think we all
get the point. More outrage over this issue from Atlas Shrugs: <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2007/02/un_pimps_for_is.html">UN Pimps

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas - that illustrious,
Holocaust-denying &#8220;moderate&#8221; - has openly stated that his primary
concern is with forwarding &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; national interests, and <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894478361&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">not
necessarily with making peace with
Israel</a>.
Will anyone listen to him this time? Certainly not in the halls of power
in Washington and Jerusalem. For all the world to hear, Abbas stated on
Tuesday that the power-sharing deal he struck with Hamas this month in
Mecca was not intended to bring the terror group in line with
international peace principles. > &#8220;We told Israel that this agreement
was made to protect the unity of the Palestinian people [sic] and its
national interests,&#8221; Abbas told reporters in Amman. &#8220;The agreement is an
expression of support for Palestinian interests, but Israel may have
misunderstood it.&#8221; The problem for Israel is that &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
interests, as expressed in the overwhelming election of Hamas, are
primarily centered on the destruction of the Jewish state. For Abbas to
&#8220;protect&#8221; those interests by making himself a fig leaf for Hamas&#8217;
virulent positions should be evidence of where this &#8220;peace&#8221; process
really stands. I don&#8217;t think Israel misunderstood anything. I think that
more and more Israeli officials are finally waking up to the fact that
the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are not and never were real peace partners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One Jerusalem has a petition going to <a href="http://onejerusalem.org/templeMount.asp">protest US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s apparent siding with the
Muslims</a> over the ridiculous
controversy surrounding what amounts to fairly minor renovation work by
Israel at the Temple Mount. According to the news wires: > Rice &#8220;says
(Muslim) concerns about Israeli renovations near a revered Jerusalem
mosque are justified.&#8221; One Jerusalem decries the fact that Rice is
certainly aware that the work being done by the Israelis is <a href="http://www.onejerusalem.org/blog/archives/2007/02/secretary_rice.asp">coming
nowhere near the foundations of the mosques atop the Temple
Mount</a>,
and that the matter is being used as an excuse to fan the flames of
anti-Israel violence. Likewise, they point out that Rice has never made
a similar fuss over the Muslims&#8217; enormous unauthorized excavations
directly underneath the Temple Mount that has led to the destruction of
centuries of Jewish history. I would add to that analysis that Rice, and
therefore the United States government, is actually aiding in Islam&#8217;s
suppression of religious freedom in Jerusalem. You see, the gate that
the Israelis are trying to make accessible again is the only entrance to
the Temple Mount that Jews and Christians are allowed to use. If that
gate is made permanently unusable, then the Temple Mount - holiest site
on earth to the Jews and many Christians - will become off-limits to
anyone who is not a Muslim. Kind of like Mecca, but inside a democratic
and free state.</p>

&#8220;moderate,&#8221; <a href="http://smoothstone.blogspot.com/2007/02/pmw-abbas-sends-warmest-greetings-to.html">sent a warm greeting to Iranian demagogue Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad last
week</a>
to mark the anniversary of Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolution. More worrying than
the letter itself, however, is this line contained within: > &#8220;&#8230;on

most heartfelt wishes, in a prayer to Allah, that he shall bestow on you
on this holiday further progress and prosperity.&#8221; So, in what area
exactly does Abbas wish to see Iran progress? In the suppression of
human rights by its vicious Islamic regime? Or, perhaps in its quest to
become a nuclear power so that it can face down the West and destroy
Israel? Remember when US President George W. Bush said that nations are
&#8220;either with us or with the terrorists&#8221;? Well, we all know what side
Iran is on. With such letters of greeting can it be any mystery what
side the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; and their &#8220;moderate&#8221; leadership are also on? I
have no problem with the US having gone after the Taliban and Saddam&#8217;s

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It always astonishes me how the international community simply refuses
to take the Arabs at their word. Talk about racism! For example, the
Bush administration continues to insist that the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; general
public wants peace with Israel based on the &#8220;two-state vision.&#8221; The
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; themselves are doing their best to refute that claim, but
no one is listening! According to the results of a new
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221;-conducted poll, 70% support peace with Israel, <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=33100">but only
if that peace makes Israel
disappear</a>. You see, the
&#8220;peace&#8221; they support - all 70% of them (the overwhelming majority of the
general public) - is one based on a single state where Arabs (including
the millions of so-called &#8220;refugees&#8221;) vastly outnumber Jews.
Seventy-five percent of &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; said that Israel, the Jewish
state, simply has no right to exist. Coupled with US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s earlier revelation that the new &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; unity
government is not going to meet even that <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/02/19/now-can-we-end-this-charade">most basic peace obligation
of recognizing
Israel</a>,
this should be enough to end the present &#8220;peace&#8221; process. And it should
put to rest the stupid claims that Hamas, which was overwhelmingly voted
into office, does not represent the true desires of the Palestinian
Arabs when it comes to relations with Israel. As it turns out, Hamas is
totally in tune with the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; street.</p>
