  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s claim to have a clear mandate from the
people to implement his &#8220;convergence&#8221; plan is very debatable. But let&#8217;s
say for the sake of argument that his intention to surrender almost all
of Israel&#8217;s biblical heartland does enjoy majority support. Does that
necessarily make it a good idea? There is not one shred of evidence
suggesting that after Israel withdraws from over 90 percent of Judea and
Samaria, the world will not continue to back Arab demands to surrender
the rest, including the eastern half of Jerusalem. In fact, <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/709412.html">recent
comments from
Washington</a>, from
where Olmert is hoping to gain recognition for Israel&#8217;s new borders,
suggest the exact opposite. You see, while the American people in
general may be Israel&#8217;s unconditional friend, the powers that be in
Washington will not risk further ruffling Europe&#8217;s or the Arab world&#8217;s
feathers in order to back what its allies in Jerusalem say is best for
the Jewish state. Washington will, however, support the division of this
land. Not because Olmert says such a move is necessary, but because
Europe and the Arabs demand it. And that is where US government support
for Olmert&#8217;s policies will stop - where they cease to coincide with the
demands of Israel&#8217;s enemies. It could not be any more plain that the end
result of Olmert&#8217;s &#8220;convergence&#8221; will be that Israel divests itself of
its most valuable bargaining chips before final status negotiations even
begin. And when the day comes - 5, 10, 15 years from now - when the
world forces Israel to again sit down with the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; and hammer
out a final peace deal, what will Israel have left with which to
negotiate? Pretty much nothing, and the Arabs have consistently proven
they will not offer &#8220;peace&#8221; in return for nothing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At a time when Israel is just emerging from a devastating economic
crisis, the country&#8217;s new leftist leaders will treat themselves by
doling out an unprecedented 27 ministerial posts. Israel&#8217;s largest
cabinet ever will come at a cost to the public of over $1 million per
minister per year. The opposition Likud Party rightly responded by
saying the move proves that the members of the Kadima-Labor government
are <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498903608&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">more concerned about their personal
well-being</a>
than they are about the good of the nation. God, too, has something to
say about such despicable practices at the expense of His people: >
_This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel
who only take care of themselves! Should not the shepherds take care of
the flock? You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with wool and slaughter
the choice animals_ (or create for yourselves government positions with
large salaries)_, but you do not take care of the flock._ (Ezekiel
32:2) The outlook for Israel&#8217;s self-styled self-indulgent aristocracy is
not promising: > _As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD,
because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered&#8230;and
because My shepherds&#8230;cared for themselves rather than for the
flock&#8230;I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for My
flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds
can no longer feed themselves._ (Ezekiel 34:7-10)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A glimpse into the depths of delusion: 1. &#8220;Suicide&#8221; bomber slaughters
nine and wounds more than 60 others in Tel Aviv. 2. Hamas-led
Palestinian Authority unsurprisingly endorses said bombing. 3. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498903840&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">declares that said endorsement of said
bombing</a>
is evidence that the PA is no peace partner. 4. Israel will respond by
surrendering in return for nothing the lands that the PA had hoped to
gain through negotiations, says Olmert. Is this failing to make sense to
anyone else? Does anyone, outside of Israel&#8217;s own delusional leaders,
believe this will NOT encourage Hamas and their fellow terrorists to
mass murder more Jews? Or is Jewish blood really less valuable than the
very temporary international acceptance and accolades Olmert &amp; Co.
believe they will receive for dividing this land at all costs?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to the Associated Press, Washington Tuesday reiterated its
support for Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself following Monday&#8217;s Tel Aviv
&#8220;suicide&#8221; bombing, but urged Jerusalem to consider carefully the effects
any retaliatory action may have on &#8220;peace prospects.&#8221; Umm, would someone
mind explaining what &#8220;peace prospects&#8221; these guys are talking about?
Mahmoud Abbas, the &#8220;moderate,&#8221; is all but irrelevant, and the
Palestinian Authority is ruled by a group of blood-thirsty terrorist
killers who publicly supported the slaughter in Tel Aviv - a virtual
declaration of war. And even when Abbas did matter and was running the
show his positions regarding the need for Israel to vacate 100% of
Judea, Samaria and Gaza, including eastern Jerusalem, and to allow
millions of Arab &#8220;refugees&#8221; to flood the Jewish state did not differ
much from the Hamas platform. Only difference is that while Abbas
feigned peace, Hamas is open about its desire to see Israel engulfed in
an Islamic tide. How the boys in Washington can look at the situation
over here and imagine there is some prospect for peace outside of Israel
reasserting full sovereignty over the entire Land of Israel is beyond
me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel, America and Europe have taken a good first step by cutting off
both aid to and contact with the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Yet
all three continue this ridiculous charade of dealing with Mahmoud
Abbas, head of the PLO and &#8220;president&#8221; of the PA, as if he were some
separate entity capable of making decisions and implementing policy on
his own. The PA is more democratic than most governments in this region
because of Western pressure. The West can&#8217;t have its cake and eat it too
by now expecting Abbas to exercise dictatorial powers. In fact, it was
the West that pushed for Abbas&#8217; current post to either be eliminated or
made purely ceremonial. What they got was a PA equivalent in
functionality to a US Congress that appoints all government secretaries
and exercises full control over the military, while the president is
still considered the chief executive. The result is chaos and
instability. Abbas&#8217; utter impotence in this morass of power was again
demonstrated in the aftermath of Monday&#8217;s Tel Aviv &#8220;suicide&#8221; bombing.
The PLO chief condemned the attack for the harm it had done to the
&#8220;Palestinian cause&#8221; (he would take a different route to relieving the
Jews of their homeland), while the Hamas government backed it as a
legitimate act of &#8220;self defense.&#8221; Guess who&#8217;s word matters more. In the
current set-up, Abbas&#8217; displeasure with Monday&#8217;s massacre will result in
not even one arrest or any action to prevent additional atrocities. The
reason this untenable situation exists is because the West and the
Israeli government in their misguided handling of the &#8220;peace&#8221; process
believed they could side-step Yasser Arafat&#8217;s intransigence by forcing
him to create and transfer his own powers to the position of prime
minister - essentially transforming the PA from a presidential system of
government to a parliamentary one. The only problem was everyone assumed
the blood-soaked demagogue Arafat would fully relinquish his lucrative
absolute hold on government. He didn&#8217;t, and the vast power he retained
for himself then passed to Abbas with the blessing of the West, which
had apparently forgotten that it previously wanted the position of PA
&#8220;president&#8221; to be bestowed with no more real political power than the
English Throne. Well, that worked out OK so long as the majority
parliament faction, and therefore the prime minister and his cabinet,
were all of the same party as Abbas. But democracy doesn&#8217;t work that
way, and the people voted in Hamas. And so the time has come for Israel
and the West to recognize the mistake they made when Arafat was in power
and either endorse Abbas as an absolute dictator, or acknowledge his
irrelevance. Obviously the latter option would be chosen in line with
America&#8217;s democracy agenda, which would then necessitate recognizing
that the vast majority of &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; knowingly and willingly chose a
group of unrepentant terrorist killers as their leaders - something the
West is trying feverishly to avoid doing, at least publicly. It&#8217;s time
for some tough decisions. Are Israel and her allies in Washington up to
it? I doubt it. Though Hamas through its own actions may take the luxury
of choice out of everyone&#8217;s hands.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As with any terrorist attack, the aftermath of Monday&#8217;s Tel Aviv bombing
is fraught with <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3240930,00.html">heart-rending
stories</a> of
personal tragedy. The most tear-jerking of the lot involves a father,
Philip Balhasan, who was visiting Tel Aviv with his two youngest
children after promising to take them to the city to buy some CDs and
computer games as a treat for Passover. As soon as the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
killer detonated himself, sending a piece of shrapnel into Balhasan&#8217;s
heart, the loving father embraced his children tightly, told them to
call their mother, and collapsed. A short time later he was dead. Now,
the Palestinian Arabs and their apologists the world over will attempt
to draw moral equivalency with, say, the unintentional killing last week
of a nine-year-old Arab girl during an Israeli strike on known
terrorists in the Gaza Strip - an event certainly no less tragic for
that girl&#8217;s family. The difference of course lies in the fact Israel was
targeting terrorists, most of them armed at the time, who were cynically
using civilians such as that little girl as cover - a war crime under
the Geneva Conventions. Monday&#8217;s &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; bomber, on the other
hand, intentionally targeted civilians, including children, out on the
town en masse during the Passover holiday. Imagine if Israel really did
carry out acts equivalent in their moral repugnancy to those perpetrated
by the &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; Imagine if an Israeli, willing to give his own
life for the sake of slaughtering as many &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; as possible,
and enjoying the consent of his government, walked in to a crowded
Ramallah eatery one Ramadan evening and mowed down scores of Muslim
patrons. Can anyone imagine the enormity of the international outcry?
Again, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; and their apologists will point to Baruch
Goldstein and Eden Natan Zada as evidence that such attacks are carried
out by Jews against Arabs. But Goldstein&#8217;s Hebron massacre and Zada&#8217;s
Shfaram bus attack were isolated events, whereas the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have
mass murdered Jewish civilians almost more times than can be counted.
Nor did either Goldstein or Zada enjoy the support of their government
or countrymen, but were rather treated posthumously as criminals and
traitors. There simply is no moral equivalency between the combatants in
this conflict, or between the two peoples and their governments. For the
world to continue treating Israel and its Arab foes on equal moral
footing is only perpetuating the bloodshed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is no secret the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; nations of Western Europe are being
rapidly overrun by Islam. Mohammed&#8217;s hordes have been trying to conquer
the continent militarily since shortly after the religion&#8217;s inception
and subjugation of the Middle East and Northern Africa. Now they are
succeeding demographically by exploiting the loose immigration laws of
liberal Europe. So worrying has this phenomenon become that the US is
actually starting to recognize Western Europe as a new front in its
global war on Islamic terror. Said Assistant Secretary of State for
European Affairs Daniel Fried during a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing last week: > &#8220;While Islamist extremism is a global
phenomenon, we find the nature of the problem in Western Europe to be
distinct - both in its character and its potential to threaten the
United States.&#8221; It is unlikely this wake up call will resonate with most
Europeans before it is too late. But for those who believe in and track
the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, that will come as little surprise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to the Hamas Authority, the Palestinian Arabs are now at war
with Israel. Israel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.icej.org/cgi-local/view.cgi?type=headline&amp;artid=2006/04/10/753174212">decision to this
week</a>
to close it&#8217;s last remaining regional coordination office with the
Palestinian Authority in Jericho is a declaration of war, insisted
Hamas. War has only now begun? What has been going on for the past 5
years? The past decade? The past half century? How is this a declaration
of war, but the **thousands** of annual &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror attacks
against Israel - a large portion carried out by Hamas itself - are not?
War was declared a long time ago, but not by Israel. Further displaying
the hypocritical nature of the PA&#8217;s position, &#8220;President&#8221; Mahmoud Abbas
also decried the closing of the Jericho office as an Israeli violation
of signed agreements. Right. That move, and not the PA&#8217;s long refusal to
end anti-Jewish terrorism that led to such measures, is the culprit.
Could they be any more transparent?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ehud Olmert has come clean about what will be the true outcome of his
&#8220;convergence&#8221; plan, and it doesn&#8217;t look promising for Israel in the long
term. Now remember, all during the election campaign Olmert vowed he
would unilaterally set Israel&#8217;s FINAL borders by 2010, and that by doing
so in the way he intended those borders would be set according to the
best interests of the Jewish state. Like Sharon before him, it seems
Olmert was just full of empty promises. In an interview with _Time
Magazine_ this week, the fill-in leader appeared to be <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=28997">creating a
political escape hatch</a>
before even trying to implement his stated policies or fulfill his
promises. > The borders Olmert draws &#8220;will be very very close to what
**may** be the final borderlines&#8230; the lines I want to draw are
very close to the lines that I **believe** will become the political
borders. A far cry from his previous emphatic statements that Israel
would, through him, take its destiny in its own hands and do what is
best for its citizens. Anyone with any amount of sense knows that not
one single nation involved in the &#8220;peace&#8221; process is going to endorse
Olmert&#8217;s borders if the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; don&#8217;t first. And no one with any
sense expects that they will. The only borders the US and Europe - the
major power brokers behind negotiations - would even think about backing
even without Arab consent would be the pre-1967 borders. A **full**
Israeli withdrawal from **all** Judea, Samaria and eastern
Jerusalem. All Olmert&#8217;s plan is going to accomplish is to divest Israel
of any leverage it currently possesses before final negotiations even
begin, and, more dangerously, signal a clear lack of conviction in the
Jews&#8217; biblical, historical and legal rights to any of this land.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, the international media is breathless over what it perceives
as the &#8220;moderating&#8221; of Hamas. The source of their barely-contained
excitement this time: An ostensibly conciliatory letter from Hamas
Authority Foreign Minister Mahmoud al-Zahar to UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan. First reports gleefully declared that in the letter, which was
sent Tuesday, Zahar made mention of the &#8220;two-state solution,&#8221; a _de
facto_ recognition of Israel. On Wednesday Zahar took some of the wind
out of the media&#8217;s sails, insisting that &#8220;such a sentence was not used
in the letter.&#8221; He showed a <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/702504.html">copy to
Reuters</a>, which
confirmed the letter made no such mention. But still the media clings to
its insistance Zahar is moderating, pointing to his written desire to
live in peace with regional neighbors: > &#8220;Like all other people in the
world, we look forward to live in peace and security for our people to
live a dignified live in freedom and independence, side by side with our
neighbors in this sacred part of the world.&#8221; However, there is little
reason to take this as evidence Hamas is suddenly willing to live in
peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state, or is even moving in that
direction. The wording of the allegedly conciliatory portion of the
letter doesn&#8217;t even mention Israel. If Hamas were truly moderating then
why not simply come out and say, &#8220;We no longer seek Israel&#8217;s
destruction, and respect its right to exist side-by-side with us&#8221;?
Everyone insists the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; voted for Hamas for purely
socio-economic reasons anyway, so they certainly won&#8217;t be betraying
their voters with such a policy shift. Zahar&#8217;s interview with China&#8217;s
Xinhua news agency earlier this week also makes it hard to believe he or
his Hamas colleagues are undergoing a process of moderation. > &#8220;I dream
of hanging a huge map of the world on the wall at my Gaza home which
does not show Israel on it. &#8230;our dream to have our independent state
on all historic Palestine will become real one day. I&#8217;m certain of this
because there is no place for the state of Israel on this land.&#8221; Those
remarks received considerably less coverage than Zahar&#8217;s letter to
Annan, perhaps not surprisingly, as they obviously give the lie to
claims that upon assuming power Hamas ceased to be a belligerent
terrorist organization. The honey-coated wording of the last sentence of
Zahar&#8217;s letter is likely the product of Hamas&#8217; growing adeptness at
smooth-talking the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s financial benefactors, rather
than some kind of conciliatory message. In other words, its just a sales
pitch. And a fairly transparent one at that.</p>
