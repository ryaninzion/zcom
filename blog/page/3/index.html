  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel and the so-called &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; Arabs have been locked in
conflict for over 40 years now and in that time - especially over the
last decade - it has become very clear that while one side is going to
great and even exaggerated lengths to foster peace and coexistence, the
other plainly is not. The latest example of the Palestinians&#8217; approach
to their peace partners came last week, when a rocket fired from the
Gaza Strip wounded 69 young Israeli soldiers. Rather than denounce the
attack as a hindrance to peace and an unacceptable assault on their
peace partners, the Palestinians <a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/09/overwhelming-joy-at-rocket-attack.html">erupted in rapturous
celebration</a>,
which was enthusiastically covered by the Palestinian media. Isn&#8217;t it
telling that after 10 years of purported peace-making, the Palestinians
still hate Israel so deeply that the maiming and wounding of so many
young Jewish soldiers would bring them such joy? Can you imagine the
world response if Israelis spontaneously exploded in demonstrations of
triumph and jubilation whenever Palestinians were killed in Israeli
military operations? Of course, it is little wonder that the
Palestinians can so enjoy the pain and suffering of others when they
view those others as subhuman. This is how the speaker of the elected
Palestinian parliament <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=36020">referred to the Jews of Israel during a public
televised address last month</a>:
> The liberation of Jerusalem will not be achieved by means of
glittering slogans, cheap arrogance, and degrading concessions. It will
be achieved by realizing the divine path in the souls of the Muslims,
and by raising the generation of the coming victory to lead the battle
against the **brothers of apes and pigs**. On the flip side of the
coin, former Israeli army chief of staff Moshe Ya&#8217;alon recently noted
the <a href="http://www.omedia.org/Show_Article.asp?DynamicContentID=2584&amp;MenuID=603">unbelievable and unprecedented
situation</a>
whereby Israel is providing water, electrical and other infrastructure
services to a Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip that is fully at war with the
Jewish state. Despite the wild accusations that are often leveled
against Israel, the Jewish state actually fulfills Jesus&#8217; command to
&#8220;love your enemy&#8221; more dutifully than most Christians. The services
Israel provides to the Palestinian public, the medical care it give
wounded Palestinian terrorists, etc are equal to what it does for its
own citizens. Israel is in effect loving its enemy as it loves itself.
Often Israel even goes overboard and loves its enemy more than it loves
itself. Consider that Arab terrorists jailed for murdering Jews in acts
of brutal terrorism are often freed in gestures of goodwill, whereas an
Israeli Jew in jail for committing a criminal murder would never have
his or her sentence similarly commuted. Israel&#8217;s Arab enemies are
afforded a degree of understanding for their murderous behavior that
Jewish criminals do not even receive. That is overdoing the love a
little bit. What the hypocritical and god-less governments of the West
refuse to take into consideration when formulating their next big &#8220;peace
push&#8221; is that for decades now Israel has been treating its enemies in
his human, even Christ-like manner and it has achieved nothing. In fact,
the Arabs&#8217; resolve to destroy Israel is arguably stronger today than it
was 30 years ago. (I am not talking about the Arab leaders who say all
the right things in order to receive US dollars. I am talking about the
Arab masses whose venomous hatred of the Jewish state has certainly not
waned.) Further evidence that all the human efforts and goodwill in the
world is not going to produce peace in the Middle East. Better to stick
to God&#8217;s Word regarding control of the Land and Israel&#8217;s rights here,
and wait for the one true peacemaker to arrive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Jewish organization dedicated to preparing for the day the Temple in
Jerusalem will be rebuilt has issued a call for help from
Bible-believing Christians around the world amid escalating Muslim
efforts to erase any physical connection between Jerusalem&#8217;s Temple
Mount and the God of Israel. Folks, the issue of the Temple Mount is an
important one. Ezekiel chapters 43 and 44 suggest that when Messiah
returns, he will enter the Temple Mount and return with him the glory of
the Lord to the Temple. That means this building needs to be rebuilt
before Messiah will return. Why else would the enemy be so intent on
thwarting any possibility of the Jews ever constructing the Temple
described in great detail in Ezekiel chapters 40-48? Many Christians,
even staunch supporters of Israel, insist that because the spirit of God
now dwells in us that He has abandoned the holy hill where He
sovereignly decided to place His name FOREVER (1 Kings 9:3). But forever
means forever, so just because the blood of the lamb has made it
possible for the spirit of God to now dwell in us does not mean the
Temple Mount has been forsaken. Many other Christians know that the
Temple will and must be rebuilt, but believe that we have no role to
play in this, that we can just sit back and wait for God to accomplish
His will. This position ignores the fact that God has historically
worked through men to accomplish His will. It also fails to take into
consideration what our answer will be on the day we stand before the
Lord and He asks what we were doing while Allah was trying to complete
his conquest of the place our God placed His name. And so I think it is
important for everyone to read this plea for help from our Jewish
brethren at <a href="http://www.templeinstitute.org/news.htm">the Temple
Institute</a> who, like us, seek
to be zealous for the name of the Lord and to prepare the way for the
King of Kings: > The Christian people must rise up and stand with their
brethren in Israel and make their voices heard to stop this travesty. We
are asking Christians to do everything possible to petition the Israeli
government to halt the Waqf [Islamic Trust] destruction and have
archaeologists immediately inspect the area. A WorldNetDaily article
<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57476">covering this
appeal</a>
provides this address for emailing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s office:
<a href="mailto:pm_eng@pmo.gov.il">pm_eng@pmo.gov.il</a> The letter to Christians
continues: > As a result of destructive and wanton bulldozing by the
Waqf - with Israeli permission - a section of the wall of the Holy
Temple in the area universally recognized as the location of the Women&#8217;s
Court has been unearthed. This is the first time since the destruction
of the Second Temple that actual physical evidence of the Temple has
been revealed. But all of the antiquities of the Temple that have been
uncovered are in danger of being destroyed if you don&#8217;t help. > > &#8230;
> > This is an attack by enemies of the G-d of Israel against Him, and
His plan for all humanity. The Bible consistently emphasizes the
centrality of the Holy Temple in the life of mankind; it is none other
than the ‚Äúfootstool‚Äú of G-d in this world (Lam 2:1). The purposeful
destruction of remnants of the Holy Temple are an attempt to undermine
G-d&#8217;s sovereignty, and to erase His name from the one place on earth
that He has chosen to manifest His presence throughout the saga of human
history. > > &#8230; > > Aside from the political implications regarding
the future of Jerusalem and Israel and the direct effect that this will
have on the entire world - the spiritual implications of what is now
transpiring are enormous. > > Allowing this sacrilege to continue, or
alternatively - expending every effort to stem it, will constitute a
direct indication as to how much we are willing to commit to the
promises of G-d, and how much are we willing to commit to upholding His
honor. > > The Bible clearly indicates that all humanity will be
uplifted to a new and unparalleled level of unity when the Holy Temple
is rebuilt. ‚ÄúAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
mountain of the L-rd&#8217;s house shall be established on the top of the
mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all the nations
shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us
go up to the mountain of the L-rd&#8230;‚Äù (Isaiah 2). > > &#8230; > > This
is the time for action. &#8230;I urge all those of you who stand with the
people of Israel, who express deep commitment and concern for her fate,
who identify with her mission and cherish her G-d, to rise up together
with your brethren, the faithful, observant and G-d fearing Jews, and
make your voices heard. > > &#8230; > > I urge each and every true
friend of Israel to personally fulfill the verse ‚ÄúFor Zion&#8217;s sake I will
not hold my peace, and for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not be
still&#8230;‚Äú (Isaiah 62:1). Do not be silent, do not be still! Make your
voices heard in the clearest possible manner. Look deeply into your
hearts, seek guidance from our Creator, and decide upon your course of
action - a course that will allow you the merit of participating in
G-d&#8217;s unfolding plan of redemption for all mankind. A course of action
that will make it clear in the most unequivocal terms, to Israel&#8217;s
enemies - from within and without - that you stand for the honor of the
G-d of Israel. > > Rabbi Chaim Richman > Director, International
Department > The Temple Institute The email address for Olmert&#8217;s office
again: <a href="mailto:pm_eng@pmo.gov.il">pm_eng@pmo.gov.il</a> I leave it to all
of you to obtain the contact information of your local and national
representatives and to make sure they are aware of what is going on and
that you, as Bible-believing Christians, will not stand for it. For a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The issue of so-called ‚Äúillegal‚Äù Jewish settlement outposts in Judea and
Samaria is often in the news, and can present a difficulty for Israel
advocates when confronted by detractors of the Jewish state. It is,
therefore, important for Israel&#8217;s friends abroad to educate themselves
on this topic so as to be able to effectively argue Israel&#8217;s case even
opposite those who have no interest in the Bible and the legitimacy it
lends the Jewish people in settling the land. Jameel over at the Muqata
has posted an <a href="http://muqata.blogspot.com/2007/09/illegal-unauthorized-outposts-faq.html">excellent
FAQ</a>
regarding the status and history of these outposts, providing more than
enough ammunition for those who find themselves defending Israel&#8217;s right
to build in its biblical heartland. The most important part of the FAQ
is the point dealing with whether or not the outposts are illegal under
Israeli law: > The government-commissioned Sasson report admitted that
‚Äúfrom the beginning of the nineties&#8230;governmental bodies and public
authorities&#8230;played a central role in establishing the outposts‚Äú. In
other words, the outposts were without any doubt sanctioned by
governmental authorities. There may not have been an official public
government decision to establish many of these outposts, but the fact
remains that the Defense Ministry, army and all other relevant parts of
the government sanctioned and aided the building of these tiny
communities. How else would roads and infrastructure have reached most
of the outposts? Of course, Israel&#8217;s foreign detractors will say that
the outposts, and indeed all the settlements, violate international law,
and are therefore ‚Äúillegal.‚Äù But this is a dubious position, to say the
least. International law states that a nation may not occupy a portion
of another nation and build settlements on that land. However, the ‚ÄúWest
Bank‚Äù was never a recognized part of another nation. The UN offered the
Arabs of the West Bank their own state in 1948. They turned down the
offer and went to war with Israel instead. It is important to note that
Resolution 181 was not a legally binding resolution - in other words it
did not establish an Arab state in the West Bank, it merely suggested
that the Jews and Arabs west of the Jordan River divide the land between
them. Jordan then occupied the West Bank from 1948-1967, though that
occupation was deemed illegal by the international community. It was
under this status - as a disputed non-sovereign territory - that the
West Bank came under Israeli control during the Six Day War. Because no
nation had ever exercised legitimate sovereign control over the West
Bank, Israel&#8217;s settlements were not built on occupied foreign territory.
Furthermore, there were Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria prior
to 1948, and those settlements were granted legitimacy by the
international community in the Mandate for Palestine bestowed on Great
Britain in 1920. In fact, the only legally binding piece of
international law dealing with control of Judea and Samaria - the 1920
San Remo Conference declaration - <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/06/06/israels-legal-occupation">unequivocally deeds that land to the
Jews</a>. Than
any Jewish presence in the West Bank is ‚Äúillegal‚Äù is a modern myth
invented by the Arabs as part of their concocted ‚ÄúPalestinian cause‚Äù and
willingly propagated by the mainstream media.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>International human rights organizations are so focused on finding ways
to demonize Israel that they are almost completely ignoring the daily
illegal use of Palestinian children in terrorist activities. Three more
Palestinian children were killed and a fourth was arrested this week
while being cynically employed by Hamas. The only condemnation of these
human rights violations came from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which
was forced to act against the youngsters in order to protect Israeli
lives. Late Wednesday night, Israeli forces operating in northern Gaza
<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123533">intercepted a 15-year-old Palestinian boy sent by Hamas on a suicide
bomb mission</a>
against Israelis. He was carrying two explosive devices. On Thursday
morning, Hamas sent three children, cousins between the ages of 10 and
12, to <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123532">adjust several rocket launchers aimed at southern
Israel</a>.
Israeli forces detected the movement around the launchers, anticipated a
rocket barrage on southern Israel, and struck first. The army
immediately issued a statement deploring the terrorists&#8217; cowardly
sacrifice of children to carry out tasks they themselves would not dare
undertake for fear of physical harm. A military correspondent revealed
on Army Radio that children sent to retrieve and adjust Hamas rocket
launchers are usually paid the paltry sum of 10 shekels (about $2.50)
for risking their lives. It is evidence of the sick state of the
international community that these incidents have not resulted in
massive and constant pressure on Hamas and the Palestinians in general
to love their children enough to not employ them or allow them to be
employed in terrorist activity. They can start by reforming the
education system in the Palestinian-controlled territories to _not_
glorify death in the name of Allah. Of course, to do that they would
need to <a href="‚%80%9Dhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596985151?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=zionistcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1596985151‚%80%9D">censure Islam

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas
met on Tuesday, and as expected the Israeli media was full of reports
asserting that Israel does in fact have a sincere peace partner on the
Palestinian side. Handshakes and smiles, however, do not necessarily
make Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, a sincere peace partner, and they
certainly don&#8217;t make him a viable one. It is very debatable that Abbas
has ever renounced, even privately in his own heart, the ultimate goal
of one day totally supplanting Israel west of the Jordan River. It is
the policy that forms the base of the PLO that Abbas today heads in
place of his deceased mentor, Yasser Arafat. But let&#8217;s pretend that
Abbas truly is willing to give up the quest to remove the Jewish state
and replace it with an Arab entity. Does that make him a partner for
peace? Maybe on a personal level, but not on a national one. The truth
is that Abbas remains either unable or unwilling to do the one thing
Israel has asked of the Palestinians in this peace process: eliminate
the threat of Palestinian terrorism against Israel&#8217;s Jews. Abbas will
never put Hamas and Islamic Jihad out of business. Heck, he won&#8217;t even
get rid of the terrorist ‚Äúarmed wing‚Äù of his own Fatah movement. And
those groups are not going to recognize and accept Israel&#8217;s existence.
So how can a real peace be concluded with Abbas if he can&#8217;t deliver the
goods? Of course, this won&#8217;t matter to the current Israeli and American
leaderships, who are just looking to get some signatures on a piece of
paper labeled ‚Äúpeace agreement‚Äù and thereby solidify their own legacies
as peacemakers. Whether it sticks or not is apparently not their
problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mayor of Bethlehem says his town is the target of an Israeli
conspiracy aimed at economically choking the birthplace of Jesus and
driving away its inhabitants. In an <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s2016908.htm">interview with ABC Radio in
Australia</a>, Dr.
Victor Batarseh claimed that in addition to building a wall around his
town, the Israeli government is convincing foreign travel agents to
dissuade their customers from visiting Bethlehem when they come on Holy
Land pilgrimages. Batarseh rejected reporter Mark Colvin&#8217;s suggestion
that perhaps Christian pilgrims are cautioned against spending too much
time in Bethlehem because of the armed terrorists operating there and
that Israel&#8217;s security barrier was really built to keep suicide bombers
out of neighboring Jerusalem. No, for Batarseh this is all a conspiracy.
Forget that Bethlehem was a major source of Palestinian terrorism
against Jerusalem prior to the building of the wall, and forget that if
Israel had wanted to choke Bethlehem it could have done so long, long
ago. The only explanation the Palestinians are willing to accept is that
Israel wants to see the demise of what Batarseh calls the ‚Äúcradle of
Christianity.‚Äù Notice the clever attempt to turn more Christians against
Israel. This is one of the reasons human efforts could never achieve
peace here, even if the Bible didn&#8217;t teach us that only the coming of
Messiah will end the conflict. Palestinians are born and bred to believe
that the Jewish state is a blood-sucking society that only seeks the
destruction of anything non-Jewish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Was Monday&#8217;s rescue of an Israeli army officer from a Palestinian lynch
mob by Palestinian Authority police officers a gesture of goodwill
toward Israel, or simply another case of the Palestinians protecting
their own interests? Israeli leaders were quick to label the incident as
evidence that the Palestinian Authority under PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas is
finally starting to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1188197167879&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">crack down on anti-Israel
terrorism</a>
and to seek peace with the Jewish state. While the officer who was saved
certainly owes his life to the Palestinian policemen who came to his
aid, the rescue must be seen in light of the upcoming US-hosted Middle
East peace summit. Abbas and his government are fully aware that the
abduction or lynching of a high-ranking Israeli army officer would most
likely prevent them from extracting concessions from Israel in the near
future. The Palestinian forces in Jenin this week were protecting their
own government&#8217;s interests, not the life of a Jewish soldier. If the
Palestinians were really interested in finally combatting anti-Israel
terrorism and moving toward a true peace, they would end the free reign
of terror groups from Abbas&#8217; own Fatah Al Aqsa Brigades to Islamic Jihad
to Hamas. The fact that these terrorists are allowed to continue
operating, bearing arms and planning attacks is the evidence Israeli
leaders should be looking at.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Egypt is a nation without external military threats to its sovereignty.
None of its neighbors can threaten Egypt&#8217;s territorial sovereignty, yet
the United States is arming Egypt at an alarming rate. The only reason
Egypt would need a strong army is just in case it decides to go to war
against Israel in the future. This has been a long-standing issue for
many, including open-eyed Israeli lawmakers and not a few US congressmen
who just do not see the logic in pouring high-quality American arms into
Egypt. To repeat: Egypt has no need of a massive, US-equipped army
except to conduct war against Israel, which is the only neighboring
country that poses any kind of military challenge, but which has
absolutely no designs on Egyptian territory. So basically the US oversaw
a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, but as part of the deal agreed
to arm Egypt for the day that treaty breaks down. Does this make any
sense? Some will argue that as part of that deal, the US also began its
massive military aid to Israel. The difference is that Israel does in
fact face numerous regional military threats to its sovereignty, and is
in great need of a strong military. Still others will argue that Israel
did in the past conquer Egyptian territory, thus the Egyptian request
for military aid to deter Israel in the future. Of course, that position
ignores the fact that Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula as a result
of repeated Egyptian aggression against and invasions of Israel. Arming
Hamas The situation is made even more ludicrous by the fact that Egypt
is directly facilitating the arming of Hamas and the establishment of
Gaza as the world&#8217;s most heavily fortified terrorist haven on earth. A
senior Israeli security official revealed this week that an astonishing
40 tons of weapons, including crates of high-grade explosives and
advanced anti-tank missiles, have been <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13892">smuggled into Gaza via the
Egyptian
Sinai</a>
over the past two months alone. Now, the Gaza-Sinai border is only 8
miles long. It is impossible to bring such an enormous amount of
weaponry across the border undetected. We are not talking about hand
guns and bags of bullets that can be hidden in luggage. We are talking
about crates of explosives and shoulder-mounted missile launchers. Egypt
is allowing the weapons to flow almost unimpeded into Hamas-controlled
Gaza at a time when the US is trying to isolate and weaken Hamas. Cairo
is also directly facilitating the activities of a group that appears on
the US list of recognized terrorist organizations. How can a nation that
is acting contrary to US interests in the region and aiding an enemy in
the global war on terror be the second largest recipient of American
military aid? Especially when the only possible use of that aid is to
wage war against a US ally?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Northern Ireland peace activist visiting Jerusalem last week made the
ridiculous assertion that if the Catholic-Protestant conflict in her
part of the world can be resolved through dialog, so can the
Israeli-Arab conflict. This is <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1187779157153&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">comparing apples to
oranges</a>.
The conflict in Ireland was a purely nationalistic one, despite the fact
that the sides were divided down Christian denominational lines. The
Catholic-dominated IRA was not bombing Protestant communities because
they were Protestant, but rather because they sided with Britain&#8217;s
continued occupation of Northern Ireland. The Irish speaker, however,
had fully bought into the lie that Arab violence against the Jewish
state is also purely nationalistic. In reality, this is a religious
conflict, a clash of civilizations, if you will. The crux of the
conflict - as Hamas and the more straightforward Arab groups will admit
- is that Islam cannot accept the loss of land it once controlled to the
Jews. Even if these peaceniks succeed in getting one group of Arabs to
sign a peace deal with Israel, the conflict will continue to rage
because to truly end it would be un-Islamic. The Koran teaches that in
fact all non-Muslim nations must ultimately be warred against until
Allah rules the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The peripheral left-wing Christian group Churches for Middle East Peace
(CMEP) is calling on American Christians to reclaim what it calls
‚ÄúChristian values‚Äù by siding with its un-biblical policy of pressuring
the US government to more rapidly implement the division of the Land of
Israel. Ignoring polls that show the vast majority of Americans side
with the Christian Zionist view that <a href="http://uspolitics.tribe.net/thread/54bafe2c-e44e-48d2-80cc-3a45c36863a7">a Palestinian state should not be
created on Israel&#8217;s ancient
heartland</a>,
CMEP claims to represent the sensibilities of mainstream Christianity in
America. In a <a href="http://www.commongroundnews.org/article.php?id=21511&amp;lan=en&amp;sid=0&amp;sp=0">recent
editorial</a>,
CMEP Executive Director Corinne Whitlatch lists as the first concern
American Christians have regarding the Middle East conflict the fact
that Bethlehem has been cut off from Jerusalem by Israel&#8217;s security
barrier. Of course, she fails to note that the barrier was only made
necessary because the Palestinian Muslims in Bethlehem just couldn&#8217;t
stop killing Jesus&#8217; Jewish brethren. Whitlatch is also wrong to list
that as the primary concern most American Christians have when examining
the conflict and America&#8217;s role in it. Most Christians in the US are
more concerned that their own government is playing midwife to the birth
of Palestine, which flies in the face of every prophecy regarding the
return of the Children of Israel to their God-given land. The Lord has
promised to deal harshly with the nations that try to divide His land,
so I am pretty sure most American Christians are worried about that, and
not about the inability of Palestinian Arabs to cross more easily from
Bethlehem to Jerusalem. Whitlatch goes on to justify highlighting such a
relatively trivial matter by demonizing Christian Zionists as a radical
fringe movement, and our views as unacceptable to the mainstream. She
claims that there is some giant phantom majority of Christians who are
all for dividing the Land of Israel in the name of justice, but that
they are simply ignored by the media. > News reports of Christians
demonstrating passionate and exclusive support for Israel&#8230;are known
throughout the Arab and Muslim world. These reports distort the reality
of American Christian sentiment. Regrettably, the moderate peace and
justice language and actions of traditional churches are rarely
considered newsworthy, making these voices within the Christian
community rarely heard. We all know that to be false since just this
month a letter signed by a mere 30 Christian leaders supporting the
creation of a Palestinian Arab state made headlines in none other than
the _New York Times_. Christians who hold these un-biblical views are
not ignored by the press, there just aren&#8217;t as many of them as CMEP
would like to believe. Whitlatch goes on to assert that it is the
‚ÄúIsraeli occupation‚Äù that is causing the recent exodus of Palestinian
Christians, and she is pushing Christian members of Congress to act
against this. How such a ludicrous position can be tolerated, I do not
know. If the ‚ÄúIsraeli occupation‚Äù is causing this exodus, then why
didn&#8217;t all the Palestinian Christians flee 30 years ago when the
so-called ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù first began? The fact is that Bethlehem was a
thriving Christian town right up until the time when Israel handed it
over to Palestinian Muslim rule! Whitlatch repeatedly references the
‚ÄúIsraeli occupation‚Äù as a major cause of the ongoing conflict, but fails
to mention Palestinian Islamic terrorism even one time. She criticizes
Congress for failing to be a good friend to both Israel and the
Palestinians, but ignores the fact that it is difficult for a society
that rejects terror to befriend one that embraces it. Though I am sure
Whitlatch is someone who would grant Palestinian terrorism the status of
legitimate resistance. So CMEP is all about reconciliation, justice and
peace in the Middle East, so long as it comes at Israel&#8217;s expense and
those pesky Bible passages about not dividing the land are not brought
up. Peace and justice are indeed biblical and Christian values, but only
when they are implemented in a way that accomplishes God&#8217;s Will as
outlined in the Bible. When peace and justice are implemented in
according to modern liberal humanist standards, they do not represent
biblical Christian values.</p>
