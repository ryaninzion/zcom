  <div class="entry-content"><p>Senior members of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s Kadima Party seem to
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3264103,00.html">waking up</a>
to the realities surrounding Olmert&#8217;s intended withdrawal from Judea and
Samaria, namely that a realignment along the lines of major settlement
blocs and an effort to set permanent borders - as Olmert promised in his
election campaign - is not going to meet with world approval.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you think it is possible to implement a unilateral realignment
plan,and realign along the three large settlement blocks - forget it.
It isimpossible. There is no support for this in the world. I am not
surethe plan will gain majority support within Kadima,&#8221; one Kadima
minister told Ynet.</p></blockquote>

<p>With this being the case, others are starting to realize that Olmert&#8217;s
plan is of absolutely no strategic value to Israel.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Withdrawing unilaterally and failing to gain approval for the final
border, undermines the entire process. What do we gain from
withdrawing from the territories, if we fail to establish a permanent
border?&#8221; the minister asked.</p></blockquote>

<p>As Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu has been <a href="http://www.arutzsheva.org/news.php3?id=87246">warning since the
beginning</a>, the only thing
Israel stands to gain from such a withdrawal is increased Arab hostility
fed by the perception of victory over the Jewish state.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/727529.html">Credible research</a>
into the demographic situation between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea is starting to gain some attention.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that there is no more of a demographic threat to the
Jewish state today than there was 20, 30 or 50 years ago. But that is
not stopping Israel&#8217;s leaders from using &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;-supplied
population figures to determine Israeli policy.</p>

<p>Stripping away all of of the politics, what is basically happening is
this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Arabs say, &#8220;Hey, we have a lot of people and we are going to
have more than the Jews in about 20 years.&#8221;</li>
<li>Israel accepts this unsubstantiated sack of lies without question.</li>
<li>Israel reacts by scrambling to surrender as much territory as
possible in order to &#8220;keep Israel Jewish.&#8221;</li>
</ol>


<p>Does this make sense to anyone?</p>

<p>(Also important to note is that all of these surveys fail to take into
account the fact that about 12 million Jews still live outside of
Israel. World events could at any time result in millions of them
seeking refuge in the Jewish state, just as the fall of the Soviet Union
did.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Previously classified documents released in the US last week show that
Yasser Arafat&#8217;s direct involvement in the 1973 murder of senior American
diplomats in Khartoum <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200606%5CINT20060606b.html">was no
secret</a>.
From an official US intelligence memorandum dated June 1973: > &#8220;The
Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge
and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.&#8221; &#8230;Arafat&#8217;s own Fatah even
&#8220;participated in the attack, using a Fatah vehicle to transport the
terrorists to the Saudi Arabian Embassy.&#8221; US Ambassador Cleo Noel and US
charge d&#8217;affaires George Curtis Moore were only murdered, along with
Belgian diplomat Guy Eid, &#8220;after [the terrorists] reportedly had
received orders from Fatah headquarters in Beirut.&#8221; Despite this,
Arafat&#8217;s public claim that a rogue terror faction not under his control
had perpetrated the attack was accepted, and State exonerated the
blood-soaked Fatah chief. This would be the equivalent of Osama bin
Laden saying, &#8220;hey, it wasn&#8217;t me,&#8221; and the US accepting that and letting
the Al Qaeda leader roam free and become and international celebrity.
The &#8220;why&#8221; of it all is obvious - the State Department and those in the
American administration of like mind have always wanted Israel to be
removed from its God-given heartland in order to create yet another Arab
Muslim state. The PLO is seen as the best chance of achieving this. If
State is willing to cover for the murder of senior US officials to see
that goal realized, how much more will they help Mahmoud Abbas and his
ilk deflect responsibility for the present killing of Israelis?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unbelievable to most, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert this week
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&amp;cid=1150191572416&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">ordered the transfer of 375 assault
rifles</a>
to Palestinian Authority security forces tasked with protecting PLO
chief Mahmoud Abbas. Unsurprisingly, those Israeli-supplied weapons
<a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50664">have already been used for a much different
task</a> - the
murder of Jews. Israel made this same mistake in arming Yasser Arafat&#8217;s
forces following the signing of the &#8220;Oslo Accords.&#8221; It was repeated with
the signing of several subsequent worthless scraps of paper. How many
times can Israel commit the same deadly blunders as it tries in vain to
convince its buddies in the West that the Jews are the good guys in this
story?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UN chief Kofi Annan has reportedly <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/930">admitted being
manipulated</a> by the anti-Israel
international press regarding the deaths of seven &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; on a
Gaza beach last week, and retracted his skepticism of Israel&#8217;s evidence
showing IDF munitions were not to blame. On Wednesday Annan <a href="http://www.zionist.com/articles/2006/06/14/annan-finds-israels-innocence-strange">found it
strange</a>
that terrorist-planted explosives, and not Israeli artillery, could
possibly be responsible for the tragic deaths. It&#8217;s all well and good
that Annan is coming clean, but the damage has already been done. The
problem is that while the international press gave broad coverage to
Annan&#8217;s influential original opinion regarding Israel&#8217;s lack of
innocense, his retraction ignored has been ignored by all but the
Israeli press. Being a world leader well acquainted with how these
things work, Annan&#8217;s retraction can hardly be accepted as a true act of
contrition. Annan knew full well that the world media would jump all
over his criticism of Israel, and then ignore any low-key remarks
contradicting his original assessment. Apology (if indeed that&#8217;s what it
even was) rejected.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>_Jerusalem Post_ columnist Yehuda Avner has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150191575275&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">pointed
out</a>
something that I for one am embarrassed to say I missed - the absurdity
of seeking terrorists&#8217; recognition of Israel&#8217;s right to exist. Avner
quotes liberally from former prime minister Menachem Begin in showing
how Israel&#8217;s current leadership should respond to international requests
that Hamas accept the Jewish state. This one thunderous declaration from
Begin as he addressed the Knesset following his electoral victory is
particularly powerful: > &#8220;We were granted our right to exist by the God
of our fathers at the glimmer of the dawn of human civilization four
thousand years ago. Hence, the Jewish people have an historic, eternal
and inalienable right to exist in this land, Eretz Yisrael, the land of
our forefathers. We need nobody&#8217;s recognition in asserting this
inalienable right. And for this inalienable right, which has been
sanctified in Jewish blood from generation to generation, we have paid a
price unexampled in the annals of nations.&#8221; Begin, in his first meeting
with former US president Jimmy Carter, even rejected the customary
American practice of reaffirming Washington&#8217;s commitment to Israel&#8217;s
right to exist. > &#8220;&#8230;our Jewish state needs no American affirmation of
our right to exist. Our Hebrew bible established that right millennia
ago. Never, throughout the centuries, did we ever abandon or forfeit
that right. &#8230;the Jewish people - no one else - are responsible for our
country&#8217;s right to exist.&#8221; Israel needs a leader like Begin, a leader
who, as Avner put it, has &#8220;a surfeit of both Jewish self-respect and &#8230;
an all-encompassing grasp of Jewish history.&#8221; Sadly, I don&#8217;t see any
such potential leaders at this point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do Israel&#8217;s leaders - and for that matter, American and European
officials - really believe that PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas is an opponent
of anti-Jewish terrorism? They sure do <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3263094,00.html">say
so</a> often
enough, though Abbas himself repeatedly contradicts that notion.In the
latest example, <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/929">former US State Department official Aaron Miller
noted</a> that Abbas&#8217; endorsement of
the &#8220;prisoners&#8217; peace plan&#8221; is in fact an official sanctioning of
terrorist violence against Israeli Jews. Certain clauses of the
much-reported document call for the establishment of a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
body responsible for coordinating all attacks on those Jews who continue
to live in Judea and Samaria. It openly condones the continued use of
terrorism against men, women and children until &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; demands
are fully met. World leader and the international press, of course, only
focused on those parts of the document that signaled a vague _de
facto_ recognition of Israel&#8217;s sovereignty. Nor is this the first time
Abbas has publicly endorsed &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists and their actions.
During his election campaign, Abbas made seea point of appearing at
public rallies with popular terror chiefs and referring to them as his
&#8220;brothers.&#8221; Last summer, Abbas played to popular sentiment by describing
Israel&#8217;s withdrawal from Gaza as a victory for the &#8220;resistance.&#8221; It does
not matter what Abbas says to the international press or world leaders.
These are the things he is telling his own people, and these are the
things that will influence their actions. Israel and the world finally
woke up to the fact that Yasser Arafat was not a good guy. It is time to
likewise recognize Arafat&#8217;s long-time comrade-in-arms, Mahmoud Abbas,
for what he really is.</p>

full-fledged terrorists, members of an organization recognized the world

peace partner&#8221; PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas has no problem with this. But
that is because Abbas does not see the Hamas killers of Jewish men,
women and children as terrorists. Can any other nation fathom having to
live with this kind of neighbors?</p>

Annan also found it strange that the Palestinian Authority refused in
every way possible to cooperate with an Israeli probe into the tragic
event. Did Annan likewise find it strange that the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221;
removed all shrapnel from victims prior to their evacuation to Israeli
hospitals, so as to deny Israel the ability to determine what kind of
weapon had harmed them? Or that the remains of whatever exploded at the
beach were quickly removed and the sand combed over, rather than leaving
evidence of the purported Israeli munitions? Or how about the fact that
news cameras were on the scene just moments after the blast? Did Annan
find that strange? Sadly, I don&#8217;t find it strange that despite all these
unanswered questions, Annan and the world without hesitation
unequivocally blamed Israel.</p>
