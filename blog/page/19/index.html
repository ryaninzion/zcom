  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much of the world is continuing to have trouble deciding if Islamic
terrorism is a mere crime, or an act of war. This stems from the fact
that while major terror groups usually have state sponsors, their
actions are not carried out on behalf of any particular nation. Even so,
the real problem is the liberal humanistic mindset that now dominates
international decision making. It insists on seeing the world according
to national boundaries, when in fact the enemy is spiritual,
transcending current borders. This has started to change in both Israel
and the US, though both nations continue to resist the notion that the
world is experiencing a clash of civilizations or religions. Israel
regularly and publicly decries &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; and Lebanese terrorism as
acts of war, and in most cases begins to respond accordingly, though
liberal elements at home and concerns over criticism abroad usually
bring an abrupt end to any military counter-action. Up until September
11, 2001, the US fell into the category of treating terrorism as a
crime, launching investigations into individual attacks rather than
going to war against its enemy. But America&#8217;s Christian leader remained
clear-headed that day, and openly acknowledged that a global battle
between good and evil, light and dark was under way and that it was time
for his nation to join the fight. However, both Israel and the US will
continue to find themselves fighting an uphill battle so long as they
act as apologists for Islam, the so-called &#8220;religion of peace,&#8221; rather
than demanding accountability from the followers of Allah. They will
continue to find themselves fighting an uphill battle until they fully
recognize that this is a clash of civilizations that has been raging
since the advent of Islam and before, and stop allowing modern political
boundaries to have such impact on their response. And lastly, they will
continue to find themselves fighting an uphill battle until they fully
come to terms with the fact that this is a war, and as such can only
have one of two outcomes - victory or defeat. There can be no negotiated
middle ground.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s ability to deter Muslim terrorist aggression against its people
is on the line in a big way in southern Lebanon. If Hizb&#8217;allah survives
its fight with Israel, terrorists everywhere will get the message that
they can hit the Jewish state hard without fear of suffering
annihilation in response. They will understand that Israel will never be
allowed to do to them what America is doing to Al Qaeda and its allies.
Eli Hertz
<a href="http://www.mythsandfacts.com/Conflict/1/A_secure_israel.htm#B1">summarizes</a>
the issue well: > &#8220;Unfortunately, Israel&#8217;s power of deterrent against
&#8216;low signature&#8217; guerrilla warfare that uses Palestinian civilians as
shelter and terrorism as a political weapon has been diminished by a
host of factors, external and internal: Israel&#8217;s isolation in the
international arena (and apologists for Arab terrorism abroad and at
home) are interpreted as an &#8216;insurance policy&#8217; that Israel&#8217;s hands will
be tied or partially tied in its response. > > &#8220;In addition, despotic
leaders&#8217; misunderstand democratic debate and Israeli society&#8217;s genuine
strengths and weaknesses and they misread limitations on the use of
force stemming from Israel&#8217;s Jewish and democratic ethos.
Well-intentioned policy decisions Israel has taken to defuse conflict
and avoid friction have &#8216;boomeranged&#8217; - perceived as cowering
feeble-heartedness, undermining Israel&#8217;s power of deterrent.&#8221; No one
likes to see innocent civilians suffer, especially those who are held
hostage by and oppose the actions of the terrorists in their midst. But
if Israel does not put aside all other concerns and smash Hizb&#8217;allah
now, this particular battle is just going to continue repeating itself,
ultimately at the cost of far more civilian lives on both sides.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iranian demagogue Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is either a really bad poker
player, or he is utterly confident that he is holding the winning hand
as he <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3285678,00.html">continues to make no secret
whatsoever</a>
of his agenda to see the &#8220;Zionist regime&#8221; eliminated. He even goes so
far, as the leader of a sovereign nation, to <a href="http://www.judeoscope.ca/breve.php3?id_breve=2194">question the Jews&#8217; status
as human beings</a>.
Another leader once spoke this way. His name was Hitler. With
Ahmadinejad showing all his cards, the question now is whether Israel
and the West will continue to hide behind the false defenses of
never-ending diplomacy or face their enemy head on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A prominent Israeli leftist who formerly advocated surrendering land to
Israel&#8217;s enemies <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=30356">has seen the error of his
ways</a> as a result of the
aggression pouring out of Gaza and southern Lebanon. Playwright Yehoshua
Sobol said in a recent radio interview: > &#8220;I was wrong when I thought
that withdrawing to border lines would bring peace.&#8221; Friday he went even
further, slamming those handfuls of Israelis who are demanding an
immediate cessation of hostilities against Hizb&#8217;allah: > &#8220;Anyone who
supports an immediate cease-fire is essentially supporting Hizb&#8217;allah
and it is beyond me how anyone from the Left can come out supporting
such a group.&#8221; It is a shame that it takes such tragic circumstances to
get these people to wake up, but at least they do wake up. Too bad Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert, who continues to push his &#8220;realignment&#8221; agenda,
cannot be made to open his eyes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How could Israel with its precision weapons accidentally hit a UN post
while fighting the Hiz&#8217;allah? This is how: <img src="http://www.zionist.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/hezlove002.jpg" alt="Hizb'allah UN
post" />
That is a UN observer post on the Israeli-Lebanese border, with UN and
Hizb&#8217;allah flags flying side-by-side from its walls. When UN posts ARE
Hizb&#8217;allah positions, no one should be surprised when UN personnel are
killed in Israel&#8217;s offensive against the terrorists. So I guess Kofi
Annan was right, Israel did purposely target the position. But the blood
of the four international troops killed are on his hands alone since, to
use Annan&#8217;s words, the UN &#8220;apparently deliberately&#8221; facilitated the
terrorist enemies of Israel. And the UN has the audacity to demand an
apology from Israel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>_Ha&#8217;aretz_ military correspondent Ze&#8217;ev Schiff <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=30321">rightly points
out</a> that Israel has no
choice but to win its fight with Hizb&#8217;allah, and must resist
international pressure for a ceasefire that would result in any
alternative outcome. Hizb&#8217;allah at this point is simply fighting to
survive. If it can come out of this mini war with even some of its
fighting capability intact, it will be seen as having won a great
victory by confronting Israel and then outlasting the Jewish state&#8217;s
response. This, Schiff warns, will create &#8220;strategic parity between
Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah.&#8221; In its early days, Israel paid dearly in four
full-scale wars to establish a deterrence that has for decades held its
foes in the wider Muslim world at bay. But if it now fails to actually
defeat Hizb&#8217;allah, the perception of Israeli strength will be shattered,
and other more powerful enemies will be greatly tempted to implement
their &#8220;final solution&#8221; to the &#8220;Zionist problem.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan and his buddies are trying really hard to keep news of
Israel&#8217;s accidental killing of four UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon
on the front pages. But the truth is, the UN itself is to blame for the
deaths of those four international troops. Israeli bombs may have
(unintentionally) taken their lives, but if UNIFIL (the UN Interim Force
In Lebanon) had done the job it was given 28 years ago, Israel wouldn&#8217;t
have to be dropping bombs at all today. UNIFIL was given a mandate in
1978 to keep hostile forces away from northern Israel and help the
Lebanese government extend its authority over southern Lebanon. It
failed miserably (or didn&#8217;t even try), leaving Israel with no choice but
to invade in 1982 and push Yasser Arafat&#8217;s PLO out of range of the
Jewish state. In May 2000, Israel gave UNIFIL another chance by vacating
southern Lebanon. But again, the &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221; force refused to do
anything about Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s control of southern Lebanon and aggression
against Israel. In fact, not only did UN troops sit by and watch as
Hizb&#8217;allah abducted three IDF soldiers in October 2000, it was later
discovered that the terrorists actually used UNIFIL vehicles to enable
them to get close enough to the Israelis undetected. But Israel, in its
deep desire to see the international community live up to its word,
stayed out of Lebanon and continued to entrust the safety of its
northern residents to an impotent foreign force. But the massive assault
earlier this month was the straw that finally broke the camel&#8217;s back.
Why did UNIFIL not prevent Hizb&#8217;allah from launching that provocation?
It&#8217;s almost as if the world wants Israel to get sucked into these orgies
of violence just so it has another chance to condemn the Jewish state.
UNIFIL could have avoided yesterday&#8217;s casualties by having done its job
in the first place. And after deciding not to do its job, UNIFIL should
have promptly removed its troops from the area when it became clear
Israel would have to the job for it. Helping to facilitate the creation
of a war zone, then placing your own people right in the middle of it,
and then blaming the nation suffering aggression out of that war zone
for accidentally killing your people is utter foolishness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Washington has been firm in its support of Israel&#8217;s war against
Hizb&#8217;allah, but has also pressed Israel hard to take great care to not
harm or topple Lebanon&#8217;s current government. The Bush administration
argues that a lot of effort went into ejecting Syria from Lebanon and
getting this democratically-elected government in place. That may be so,
but if the government of Lebanese PM Fuad Siniora is unable or unwilling
to govern in an effective manner that safeguards the well-being of both
Lebanon&#8217;s and Israel&#8217;s citizens, then why in the world should Israel
care about preserving it? Rather than take a firm stand against
terrorism, Siniora granted Hizb&#8217;allah - which hold 23 seats in Lebanon&#8217;s
parliament - two cabinet positions. Furthermore, Siniora has refused to
take any action on UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which demands
the deployment of Lebanon&#8217;s army in the southern regions of the country,
and the disarming of Hizb&#8217;allah and any other unauthorized armed groups.
The argument that Siniora&#8217;s government and the Lebanese army are simply
not strong enough at this point to take on Hizb&#8217;allah does not hold
water. Everyone, including Siniora, knows that if after moving against
Hizb&#8217;allah the Lebanese authorities found themselves unequal to the
task, the US and Israel would at once offer more than adequate
assistance. Instead, Siniora has allowed Hizb&#8217;allah to remain in place,
gaining strength and legitimacy, while providing the group with direct
influence in his government. All of which contributed to the current
crisis. Under Bush&#8217;s &#8220;either you are with us, or you are with them&#8221;
policy, Lebanon&#8217;s government has no legitimacy and should be removed.</p>

used the UN base as cover for attacks on the Israelis, prompting IDF
return fire close enough to the position that any slight deviation would
harm the foreigners.) Immediately following the incident, UN chief Kofi
Annan admitted to reporters that he was still &#8220;trying to get all the
