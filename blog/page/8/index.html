  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that things are starting to settle down and I am getting into a
routine at <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/04/25/new-job-at-israel-today">my new
job</a>, I have
every intention of resuming my daily writing here at Zionist.com. Those
familiar with Zionist.com will notice a few minor changes to the site. I
have significantly slimmed down the site in terms of features. The truth
is that Zionist.com does not support my family and I, and therefore must
take a back seat in terms of attention and devoted work time to my
paying job. As readership here increases and Zionist.com does begin to
provide a degree of financial support, I will gradually increase the
amount of attention the site receives, including adding new features and
resources, until Zionist.com is the full-fledged, Bible-based,
pro-Israel community site I always intended it to be. Until then, I want
to focus on producing the core content - daily commentary on what is
happening here on the ground - and not be distracted by trying to do too
many other things that I simply don&#8217;t have time for. Anyway, enough of
my rambling. The bottom line is that Zionist.com is more focused now,
and will again be updated on a daily basis. So check back regularly!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found it very interesting that the overwhelming majority of Israelis
are perfectly satisfied with their lives, despite the daunting array of
problems their nation faces. Israel is constantly under physical attack
from its enemies, the international community and mainstream
international press in general seem to hate the Jewish state, economic
conditions in Israel are often less than ideal and the leadership in
Jerusalem is hopelessly corrupt. And still, a huge <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13119">83% of
Israelis</a>
are satisfied with what they have here. (Interestingly, 71% of the Arabs
who participated in the survey said they too are satisfied, contrary to
the regular bellyaching by their Knesset representatives.) Now, what is
interesting to me is the comparison between Israel&#8217;s situation and the
reaction of its people, and how people view life in Scandinavia. The
Scandinavian counties in northern Europe have no external existential
threats, no terrorist attacks, little corruption and the socialist
systems there do an outstanding job of caring for people&#8217;s needs.
Nevertheless, suicide rates in Scandinavia are among the highest in the
world. A similar situation exists in Japan, a nation with enormous
wealth and prosperity, but where far too many people are just unhappy.
How can this be? Aren&#8217;t we taught by our Western culture that prosperity
and popularity will make us happy?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An Israeli investigative news television program carried a story last
night regarding a four-year-old Sudanese girl who was abducted by
Egyptian soldiers last month as she and her family tried to make their
way into Israel. Many Sudanese fleeing from the genocide in Darfur have
made their way to Egypt, only to find their hosts nearly as hostile as
the Arab militiamen who drove them from their homeland. Those who have
read a Bible or have knowledge of the Nazi Holocaust have then turned to
Israel and the Jews for refuge. In a telling display of their
hospitality, Egyptian soldiers have taken to shooting at desperate
Sudanese refugees as they make a dash for the border. Venus, the little
girl at the center of last night&#8217;s story, was a victim of one such
incident. When the Egyptians opened fire on Venus and her parents less
than 100 yards from the border, the frightened family began to run. But
little Venus&#8217; legs could not carry her fast enough, and the toddler was
separated from her parents in the chaos. After crossing the border,
Venus&#8217; parents turned around to see the girl had been taken by Egyptian
soldiers. They begged for her release, but the Egyptians refused and
demanded the parents return to their custody. The distraught mother and
father were then picked up by Israeli soldiers, who immediately began to
make calls to those who could assist in the situation. To make a long
story short, following five days of intense negotiations that involved
the heads of intelligence and the first ladies of both Israel and Egypt,
Venus was finally returned to her parents, who had by that time taken up
residence and been given jobs in the southern Israel resort town of
Eilat. As I watched this report I became infuriated at the fact that the
stories of Venus and so many others like her are being almost completely
ignored by the mainstream international press, the United Nations and
the loudmouth human rights organizations that are never at a loss for
words when it comes to criticizing Israel. Innocent people, refugees
with nothing but the shirts on their backs, are being shot at by heavily
armed soldiers for absolutely no reason other than to satisfy their
cruel urges. And no one says a word. Can anyone imagine the outcry if
Israeli soldiers were the ones firing on these poor souls? It gets
worse. Earlier this month, in my capacity as a reporter for <em>israel
today</em>, I <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=128&amp;view=item&amp;idx=1411">interviewed a Sudanese
refugee</a>
who had been in Egypt for about two years before coming to Israel. Among
other things, he recounted how in late 2005 the Sudanese in Egypt had
held a three-month mass demonstration opposite the UN&#8217;s office for
refugees in Cairo. Though the refugees were protesting against the UN
and its lethargic response to their situation, the Egyptians became fed
up, and ordered the Sudanese to vacate the square they had occupied.
When threats failed, the Egyptians turned to violence. This man told me
that one night in late December 2005, Egyptian soldiers surrounded the
thousands of Sudanese gathered in central Cairo - a gathering that
included a large number of women and small children - and doused them
all with water. The soldiers then sent massive electrical shocks through
the crowd, causing an untold number of injuries. Then it really started
to get bad. When the Sudanese continued to refuse to leave, the soldiers
began to beat and shoot at the unarmed refugees. At least 25 were
killed. Did anyone ever hear about this in the mainstream press? I
subsequently tried to look it up, and while some small Sudanese news
networks and a few personal blogs reported on the massacre, it appears
that not one major news outlet carried the story. UN officials here in
Israel later confirmed for me that this atrocity did in fact take place.
These stories provide further evidence that the international community
in general does not really care about the suffering of displaced,
dispossessed and oppressed peoples in other parts of the world. If the
world really cared, then there would have long ago been massive global
movements and special UN committees for the Sudanese, the Kurds, the
Tutsis of Rwanda, etc. The only reason these things exist for the
Palestinians - who by comparison represent almost a non-issue in terms
of human rights - is because Israel and the Jews are on the other side
of the equation. Mask it with whatever terms or special causes you want,
but anti-Semitism is alive and well today, and the proof is in the
enormously disproportionate attention received by those who claim to be
victims of the Jews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel this week marked 40 years since its stunning victory over vastly
superior Arab forces in the 1967 Six Day War. The rest of the world
remembered the event by unleashing a flood of criticism over Israel&#8217;s
continued “occupation” of Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. When
Israel&#8217;s detractors speak of the “illegal occupation” they are basing
their position on UN Security Council Resolution 242. However, an honest
examination of the resolution and the subsequent events of of the past
four decades reveals that Israel&#8217;s control of these territories in fact
constitutes a legal occupation. The US and British authors of 242 were
deliberately ambiguous when they called for an Israeli withdrawal from
territories captured during the war. They did not demand that Israel
leave “the territories” or “all territories,” but simply “territories.”
Nor did they determine that Israel was required to hand lost territories
back to each of the three offending Arab states - Egypt, Syria and
Jordan. Again, the resolution simply says “from territories” without any
specification whatsoever regarding how much of each of the different
territories was to be returned. Since 1967, Israel has relinquished
control of well over 90% of the territories it captured in the Six Day
War, including the entire Sinai Peninsula, the whole of the Gaza Strip
and large portions of Judea and Samaria. It is safe to say from a legal
standpoint that Israel has fulfilled its primary obligation under
Resolution 242. What&#8217;s more, Jordan waived its right to complain about
receiving no land concessions from Israel when, in 1988, it publicly
backed Palestinian sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. With 242 satisfied,
and Jordan renouncing its claim to the “West Bank,” Israel&#8217;s possession
of Judea and Samaria as far as that landmark resolution is concerned is
absolutely legal. Taking the argument even further, it is important to
note that 242 and every other UN resolution regarding Israel and the
Middle East conflict since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948
have been passed under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. That means they are
in effect nothing more than recommendations on conflict resolution, and
not legally binding rulings. The last and only legally binding
international decision regarding control of the land remains the closing
statement of the 1920 League of Nations conference in San Remo, which
granted Great Britain the right to temporarily govern the area known as
“Palestine” with the intent of facilitating “close Jewish settlement” in
all of what is today Israel, the Palestinian-controlled territories and
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. That document - which, again,
constitutes international law - actually acknowledges the “historic ties
between the Jewish People and the Land of Israel,” which everyone in
1920 recognized as including Judea, Samaria, Gaza, the Golan Heights and
the mountainous territories east of the Jordan River. If the Palestinian
Arabs want to dispute Israel&#8217;s control over those areas based on their
own presence there, that is one thing. But to claim that their cause is
backed by modern international law is a grievous distortion of facts.
Unfortunately, in today&#8217;s world, dishonest slogan-based propaganda
usually wins out over truthful and thorough fact-checking in the battle
for people&#8217;s hearts and minds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elder of Zion has <a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/06/eastern-palestine.html">a good
post</a>
regarding the fact that 100 years ago, all of what is today Israel, the
Palestinian-controlled territories and Jordan was referred to (by the
British and those who followed their exampe) as “Palestine” - the
mythical ancient homeland of the equally mythical “Palestinian” people.
The post goes on to ask why there is no movement today to free eastern
“Palestine” from Jordanian (Hashemite) occupation like the one seeking
to end Israel&#8217;s control over western “Palestine” (the so-called “West
Bank”). It is a good question that has one obvious answer, and one
forgotten answer. The obvious reason that western “Palestine” is a focus
of such great attention while eastern “Palestine” is not is that the
former is controlled by non-Muslims, and not only non-Muslims, but Jews
- the one people group that Islam&#8217;s Mohammed prophesied would one day be
betrayed by the very stones and trees for their alleged treachery. The
forgotten reason for the same is that rather than enter into dialogue
and a “peace process” with the self-proclaimed “liberators” of
“Palestine,” Jordan&#8217;s King Hussein unleashed his armed forces against
Yasser Arafat&#8217;s ilk and drove them from his country. Make no mistake,
the PLO, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, etc still dream of one day overthrowing
the Hashemite Kingdom and taking all of British Palestine for
themselves, but realize that attempting to do so any time in the near
future would likely mean the death of their cause. Israel could have
struck the same fear in its enemies, but instead chose to bow to
international pressure and treat Arafat as a partner in the vain hope of
creating a “new Middle East.”</p>

In all seriousness, this AFP photo looks so fake. If it is fake, I have
no evidence of it, and the Photoshop doctoring is really good. However,
the whole scene is just wrong. That is a high-precision laser-guided
bomb, and it appears to be landing in an open area for the sake of
killing a group of kids. Those kind of bombs don&#8217;t miss, and they are
_very_ expensive. So it could not be that far off its mark, and Israel
would never use such a costly weapon to kill children, even if the
Jewish state was actually a blood-thirsty, child-killing machine, as the
Arabs claim. Furthermore, those kids appear to actually be able to be
watching and tracking the bomb as it descends at enormous speeds. And
what amazing luck the photographer had to have just snapped his shot as
the bomb entered the frame. In truth, with a clear blue sky like that as
a background, this would be a very easy Photoshop deception to create. I
have very limited Photoshop skills, and I could make this one work. But,
again, I have no actual proof that this is a fake. Maybe a bunch of
Palestinian kids really were foolish enough to be congregating around
one of the Hamas installations targeted by Israel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lebanon&#8217;s military forces have for the past week been pounding Islamic
terrorists operating out of a Palestinian &#8220;refugee camp&#8221; in the north of
the country. Not wanting to risk large military casualties, the Lebanese
army has primarily been using tank fire and artillery to target their
enemies. According to numbers presented by the media, at least 50
terrorists have been killed, along with untold numbers of civilians. All
of the above is fine and well. I certainly feel regret that civilians
unable to defend themselves are being caught up in this, but the
Lebanese absolutely have the right to make war upon their terrorist
foes, even if that enemy is using a civilian population as a shield. And
the Lebanese have the right to do so in a way that will most minimize
casualties to their own forces. What is not fine and well is that the
international community is so supportive of the Lebanese anti-terror
offensive, while being so vocally opposed to every Israeli effort to
extinguish the scourge of Palestinian terror. In an editorial posted to
its website on Saturday, the _Jerusalem Post_ <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708686752&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">drew a
parallel</a>
between the ongoing Lebanese operation and Israel&#8217;s Operation Defensive
Shield, a massive April 2002 assault on terrorist positions throughout
Samaria. The scope of both operations is similar, from a military
viewpoint. The international reaction, however, could not be more
different. During the Israeli operation, the bloodiest fighting of which
took place in Jenin, the Arab world was generally supported by the
international media and UN in its claims that Israeli forces were
committing a massacre of Palestinian civilians. Even after the dust
settled and it was clear no massacre had occurred, UN bodies and human
rights groups still conducted investigations ending in the predictable
accusation that Israel had committed war crimes. All of this despite the
fact that Israel avoided the use of air power and artillery in order to
minimize not its own casualties, but those of the Palestinians.
Meanwhile, the Lebanese are pounding the Palestinian suburb of Nahr
el-Bared with hundreds of artillery shells every day, killing who knows
how many people and wreaking untold destruction. And where are the Arab
League, the human rights groups and the international media? Mum.
Everyone of them is mum. No calls for an investigation, no wild claims
of a massacre, no pleas for the protection of innocent Palestinians.
This, my friends, is ample evidence that the Arab world and the
international community do not really care about the so-called
&#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; What they care about is eradicating the Jewish state,
and the Palestinian Arabs just happen to be the best tool to accomplish
that at present.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s leadership insists that this week&#8217;s massive Hamas rocket
barrage on the Negev region is an attempt to draw Israel into the Gaza
Strip in order to unify warring Palestinian factions. Israel, the
politicians vow, will not take the bait. While that may indeed be Hamas&#8217;
short term goal, Israel&#8217;s government is yet again demonstrating a
detrimental inability to see beyond the immediate horizon. The long-term
diplomatic consequences of not responding to the ongoing rocket fire
from Gaza in an overwhelming and even shocking manner far outweigh the
short-term international criticism Israel would face for invading the
blood-drenched coastal strip. Allow me to briefly explain. Even from a
secular liberal viewpoint, which is how Israel&#8217;s current leadership
approaches the situation, not launching a crushing military response
will result in a setback for Israel in the &#8220;peace&#8221; negotiations it so
desperately wants to conduct with the so-called &#8220;moderate&#8221; Palestinians.
Every time the Palestinians escalate their aggression and Israel fails
to respond with even more severe military action, then ending that new
level of Palestinian aggression becomes the benchmark for Palestinian
compliance. In the beginning, what was requested of the PLO was to keep
arms out of the hands of groups like Hamas, to prevent unauthorized
weapons from ever entering &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; territories. Since every
Palestinian and his mother are now armed, clearly no one is making that
demand anymore. It has already been violated in an irreversible way.
Then we moved on to stopping certain groups from carrying out bus
bombings. The Palestinians never complied, but thank God Israel itself
has managed to curb that threat. Now we are seeing a far more strategic
threat - cross-&#8220;border&#8221; rocket fire. And Israel is allowing that rocket
fire to become a bargaining chip. When Israeli leaders next meet their
Palestinian counterparts for &#8220;peace&#8221; talks, what they will demand is an
end to the rocket attacks. The Palestinians are effectively controlling
what it is the Israelis will ask for at the negotiating table, and they
are making sure it won&#8217;t be anything too substantial for them in the
long-term; they are making sure they won&#8217;t ever have to really
compromise. Israel could very simply end this situation by responding to
escalating Palestinian aggression in kind. As soon as the Palestinians
increase their rocket fire, Israel should invade Gaza and carry out
unceasing and crushing military operations everywhere. Israel should
make life 10 times more unbearable for the Palestinians than they are
making it for the residents of southern Israel. And Israel should not
stop doing that until the Palestinians cease their fire. The negotiating
point for the next round of talks should be Israel ending its
frightening display of military power in exchange for an end to
Palestinian rocket fire - period. Nothing more. Israel should not have
to trade more security and land concessions for a temporary reprieve
from ever-escalating Palestinian aggression. Of course, going this route
would mean flipping the bird to an incensed international community,
which means that despite the obvious, Israel&#8217;s current leaders won&#8217;t
even consider it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Palestinians so often openly display their hypocrisy for the world
to see, and the world almost nearly as often ignores it. The latest
example of this hypocrisy comes amid the escalating internal strife in
Gaza that this week spilled over into southern Israel in a big way. As
of Thursday evening, Gaza-based Palestinian terrorists have fired more
than 80 rockets at the southern Israel town of Sderot and surrounding
communities over the past several days. Many have been wounded, and
numerous buildings, including schools, have been damaged. A simply
unacceptable display of aggression that no nation on earth would
countenance as Israel has. And then Israel responds, albeit in an
extremely limited fashion. Instead of employing the overwhelming force
Washington preaches when it retaliates against its enemies, Israel
responded to this week&#8217;s massive rocket fire by bombing two Hamas bases
in Gaza, one of which was empty. Never mind that Hamas had been pounding
southern Israel for days, deliberately targeting Jewish civilians. The
moment Israel dared to drop a couple bombs on Gaza, that, according to
the Palestinians, is when the situation escalated, that is when someone
crossed the line. Pure hypocrisy. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. Let&#8217;s take a
moment and consider the response of PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas and other
Palestinian &#8220;moderates&#8221; to the Hamas rocket fire on Israel. Oh, wait,
they never did respond! No declaration of condemnation whatsoever from
Israel&#8217;s &#8220;peace partners.&#8221; Nor has Abbas and his &#8220;moderate&#8221; buddies
clawed into Hamas and those responsible for the street violence in Gaza
as they consistently do the Jewish state when people die in Israeli
anti-terror military action. I mean, isn&#8217;t the message from these
&#8220;moderates&#8221; that they just want to live in peace and security, to live
normal, prosperous lives? Then why don&#8217;t they launch into the kind of
diplomatic frenzy against Hamas that they regularly employ against
Israel? Sure, there have been a few muffled criticisms, but nothing like
the diplomatic blitz the Palestinian Authority so masterfully wields
when Israel kills Palestinians. The whole thing just smacks of
hypocrisy. And the international media and Western powers simply ignore
that aspect of it all. Just so we are clear on the rules of this game:
1. The Palestinians are allowed to bombard Israel in unprecedented
fashion, but Israel is now permitted to respond, even in a limited
manner. 2. Israel&#8217;s killing and wounding of a small number of
Palestinians during anti-terror operations is cause for an international
diplomatic uproar, while the slaughter of Palestinians by other
Palestinians in far greater numbers is merely internal political strife
that outsiders should not interfere in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/122430">firmly opposed to
dividing
Jerusalem</a> and
surrendering its eastern half to the Arabs, while unblinking she
<a href="http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/101782.html">advocates the division of the Land of
Israel</a> and the
surrender of her nation&#8217;s biblical heartland. Either Livni is just
following the polls, which is likely considering her chance to steal the
premiership from Olmert, or she is truly deluded. But even if she is
just following the polls, that means the majority of Israelis who voted
in those surveys are themselves deluded. You see, Israel cannot insist
that it has every right to maintain control over a united Jerusalem,
while acquiescing to demands that it relinquish all claims to Jude and
Samaria. If Jerusalem biblically and historically belongs to Israel and
the Jewish people, then so do Judea and Samaria. To relinquish the claim
to one puts the claim to the other on very shaky ground. And that is
precisely how the Arabs will view Livni&#8217;s recent comments. If Israel&#8217;s
leaders are so ready to part with Judea and Samaria, the Arabs must be
full of hope that sooner rather than later the Jews will be likewise
convinced to give up their holy city as well. It is the height of
foolishness for Israelis to believe that they can firmly and
unquestionably hold on to some parts of this land (like Tel Aviv), and
then turn around and agree with the Arabs that other parts are under
&#8220;illegal Israeli occupation.&#8221; The Arabs do not see the land in the same
divisions as most Israelis. They claim it all. Either all of its is
occupied or none of its is occupied. For the Arabs, it is a black and
white issue, and the Israelis would do well to remove their tinted
sunglasses so they can get a clear view of the situation.</p>
