  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; peace partners are eager to join with their
Hizb&#8217;allah buddies in assaulting northern Israel, an area of the Jewish
state they don&#8217;t get a chance to attack all too often. From <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150886008584&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">_The
Jerusalem
Post_</a>:
> &#8220;Many young men, including members of the Palestinian security
forces, want to join the fight against Israel in Lebanon,&#8221; one PA
official said. &#8220;We have thus far received hundreds of requests from
people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who have expressed their desire
to join the Lebanese resistance forces.&#8221; PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas and the
Hamas regime, however, would like these fighters to stick around a while
longer to help keep up the fight against Israel in Judea, Samaria and
Gaza: > &#8220;The Palestinian Authority has enough problems here,&#8221; the
official pointed out. &#8220;We need these men in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where we are also under attack from Israel.&#8221; The &#8220;Palestinians&#8221;
are ready to join Hizb&#8217;allah because at this point they see the terror
group giving out as good as it is getting. They see Hizb&#8217;allah as strong
and courageous: > &#8220;Hizb&#8217;allah has taught Israel a good lesson and as
Arabs and Muslims we are very proud of them,&#8221; a PA policeman from the
Ramallah district said. If Israel really wants the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to
turn into true peace partners, it needs to show its strength by
destroying Hizb&#8217;allah and Hamas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UN and EU representatives tasked with bringing an end to the fighting
between Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah are expected in Jerusalem Sunday, as
leaders of the world&#8217;s top industrialized nations meet at the G-8 Summit
in St. Petersburg with the Middle East at the top of their agenda. With
so much activity in the international community, Israeli officials
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150886009191&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">figure they have about 48-72
hours</a>
to inflict as much damage on Hizb&#8217;allah as possible before the world
steps in and forces an end to the fighting. The world always does this.
Nearly every instance in which Israel was poised to eliminate or
seriously set back the Arab threat to its citizens has been hijacked by
an internationally-imposed ceasefire. Apparently beyond the small-minded
thinking of these world leaders is the fact such behavior only prolongs
the conflict by perpetuating the existence of groups like Hizb&#8217;allah.
The Israelis know what is coming, so they need to act fast. Time to take
a page from the American playbook and employ the kind of overwhelming
force that will ensure a swift victory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The combination of rogue Islamic regimes and terrorist organizations is
a recipe for instability and mass bloodshed, and was consequently one of
the primary justifications behind America&#8217;s invasion of Iraq. Terrorist
organizations are far more likely to, <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=16971">as the Saudis put
it</a>, engage in
&#8220;irresponsible adventurism.&#8221; They only lack the resources available to a
sovereign state. Throw in an Iran, add a little Syria, and you have a
well-armed, technologically-advanced, foaming-mouthed terrorist
organization like Hizb&#8217;allah that is light years ahead of its
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; allies. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah and all their buddies
could not in their wildest dreams hope to <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/012245.php">knock out an Israeli
warship</a>. Thank God the
US took out Saddam Hussein, or we may be in a lot more trouble than we

  <div class="entry-content"><p>News that Israel&#8217;s military offensive in Lebanon is having the <a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1152914430.shtml">desired
effect</a>: > [I]n the wake of
Syria&#8217;s withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon in 2005, the disarmament
of Hezbollah has emerged as one of the foremost issues in Lebanese
politics. Since the fighting with Israel started Wednesday, calls for
Hezbollah to relinquish its weapons have gathered urgency. The article
goes on to say that Lebanese from across their nation&#8217;s fractured
political spectrum insist that Israel&#8217;s response to Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
aggression has been disproportionate. Well, if the above is true, I
would say Israel&#8217;s response has been just right, if not a little too
weak. Additional force would turn those calls for Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
disarmament into action. The fear many of us on Israel&#8217;s side share: >
The worst outcome would be for the Israelis to stop after inflicting
only minor damage on Hezbollah. This would subject Israel to
international condemnation and increase Hezbollah&#8217;s prestige for
&#8220;standing up&#8221; to Israel, while producing few benefits for either
Israelis or Lebanese.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a little tip for those seeking democracy in the Middle East: It
won&#8217;t work as long as a rogue terrorist organization, acting with
impunity while a toothless government looks on, has the country by the
balls. From the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1150886002616">Associated
Press</a>:
> US President George W. Bush expressed worries the Israeli assault
could cause the fall of the government, whose formation after elections
last year Washington hailed as a major step for Lebanese democracy after
years of Syrian control. Israel is doing far more for Lebanese democracy
than anyone is giving it credit for. The world recognized with UN
Security Council Resolution 1559 that Lebanon would not truly be free
until Hizb&#8217;allah was defanged, but has failed to back up its words with
action. Israel is just taking care of the dirty work, and should be
applauded for doing so. Ironically, the only ones giving Israel its dues
are the <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=21527_Cries_for_Help_from_Lebanon&amp;only">Lebanese
themselves</a>
(the Christian ones).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mainstream media, not to mention European governments, is
<a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1152906617.shtml">completely ignoring</a> Israel&#8217;s
careful selection of targets in Lebanon as it seeks to paint the Jewish
state as a ruthless predator. What is also being ignored is the fact
that every time Israel gets ready to strike a target that may result in
civilian casualties, it <a href="http://www.israelnn.com/news.php3?id=107347">warns everyone to get out of the
way</a>. This despite the fact
the bad guys are also notified of the impending attack and given time to
escape. When was the last time the Arabs warned Israeli Jews to get out
of the way before they attacked? Answer: Never. Reason: Israel is not
targeting civilians. The Muslim Arab terrorists, however, want to kill
and maim every single Jew they can get their hands on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel has happily acknowledged America as the leader in the global war
on Islamic terror, and so the time has come for the Jewish state to step
through the doors being opened by its ally and mimic the examples set by
the United States. Contrary to <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2006/07/bush_calling_fo.html">earlier
reports</a>,
Bush has reportedly <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/970">rejected</a>
Lebanon&#8217;s plea for an imposed ceasefire, leaving Israel free to continue
its assault on Hizb&#8217;allah. Ambassador John Bolton is <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1967665,00.html">swatting
down</a>
all attempts to issue a UN Security Council resolution against Israel,
effectively pulling the teeth from current international criticism of
Israel&#8217;s actions. And Washington has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201005.html">clearly
identified</a>
both Syria and Iran as the puppet masters behind Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s actions,
legitimizing an Israeli strike on Damascus. The doors are all open. All
that is left is for Israel to step through and learn from the US
victories in Iraq and Afghanistan: Swift, overwhelming force will end
the war before anyone has a real chance to stop it. The US cannot hold
back the world forever. The time to act is now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Flipping through the major television news networks today, I am reminded
of the unbridled bias practiced by the international media in its
coverage of the Israeli-Arab confict. The top story of the day is the
ongoing fighting in Lebanon and northern Israel. But it is only being
covered by the &#8220;objective&#8221; mainstream media from one angle. Images
abounded, accompanied by heart-rending commentary, of residential areas
of Beirut in flames. But did the media bother to explain that Hizb&#8217;allah
had, in violation of international law, purposely placed its offices and
strategic facilities in heavily populated areas? Of course not. Offering
justification for Israeli efforts to defend its citizens does not make a
good story. Nor was there one word, ONE WORD, of the millions of
Israelis who for the past 72 hours have been forced to either live in
hot, cramped bomb shelters or flee their homes. Is that too not a
humanitarian crisis?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damascus is looking to score a few propaganda points over the ongoing
fighting in Lebanon and northern Israel. Syria&#8217;s new UN ambassador, Dr.
Jafar Ja&#8217;afari, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/14/62952.shtml">told
reporters</a> in
New York Friday that prior to US-backed efforts to end Syria&#8217;s
occupation of Lebanon, the presence of the Syrian army resulted in far
fewer attacks on northern Israel. Lebanon&#8217;s own military, by comparison,
has no chance of reining in Hizb&#8217;allah. > &#8220;They have no army. It is
small, it has little control and everyone knows this.&#8221; Washington is
well aware of this fact, insisted Ja&#8217;afari, and therefore bears a
certain degree of responsibility for the current crisis. Of course, that
is all a load of crap. Northern Israel suffered far fewer attacks during
those years because the IDF had military control over southern Lebanon.
Not because the Assad regime, which is still technically at war with
Israel, was calling the shots in Beirut.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As usual, the international community - minus the United States - is
criticizing Israel for not reacting in a &#8220;proportionate&#8221; manner to
Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s aggression against its northern border. But from a military
standpoint, insisting Israel deal with such an attack in a proportionate
manner is just stupid. You cannot defeat your enemy if you only respond
with the same level of force they used against you. To win, you must be
stronger, you must be capable of unleashing MORE force than your enemy.
And then there is the fact that a proportionate response by Israel in
this case would consist of indiscriminately firing rockets into Lebanese
population centers. Certainly not something the world would countenance.
The only logical conclusion is that the world wants Israel to sit back,
let its enemies gain the upper hand and harass the Jewish state into
extinction.</p>
