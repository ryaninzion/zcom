  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rightly did Prime Minister Ehud Olmert state that Syria and Iran
represent, along with their Hizb&#8217;allah proxy, an <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525871601&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">&#8220;axis of
evil&#8221;</a>
determined not only to wipe out the Jewish state, but to bring the
entire Judeo-Christian West to its knees. Amazingly, a growing number of
senior Israeli ministers now <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/world/20060820-111535-4616r.htm">want to
treat</a> with
one of the main components of the axis - Syria. And this just days after
Syrian dictator Bashar Assad delivered his <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/750834.html">most venomous warning
yet</a> that the Jewish
state had better meet his nation&#8217;s demands or face a war of
annihilation. According to Defense Minister Amir Peretz, handing over
the Golan Heights and signing a piece of paper with Syria will cause the
latter to drop its anti-Israel affiliation with Iran and other nasties.
For some reason, many Israelis continue to think they can deal with the
Middle East on a state-to-state basis, apparently ignorant of the fact
that their Islamic enemy is one, united in its desire to see the
&#8220;Zionist entity&#8221; eliminated. This is evidenced by the fact that the
issue of Israel alone is able to cause Sunnis, Shi&#8217;ites, Wahhabis, etc
to set aside their differences for a common cause. Israel now risks
traveling the route taken by a Neville Chamberlain-led Europe prior to
World War II, when it attempted to appease Hitler by sacrificing
Czechoslovakia. We all know now, of course, that the concession only
whetted Hitler&#8217;s appetite for conquest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It would seem natural that the more powerful of two opposing forces
would dominate the cycle of escalation in any conflict between the two.
But Israel&#8217;s just-ended war with Hizb&#8217;allah - fought in a world of
up-to-the-minute newscasts and political considerations - has
discredited that theory. Every new Israeli move in the war was
immediately met by a Hizb&#8217;allah escalation - Haifa was hit for the first
time; then Tiberias; then the Jezreel Valley; then Hadera. And just the
threat of escalating the conflict by launching long-range missiles at
Tel Aviv is certain to have affected Israel&#8217;s decision making. To one
degree or another, Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s escalation capabilities helped to shape
the way Israel fought this war. Hizb&#8217;allah effectively employed
strategic deterrence against Israel. Israel must turn this situation
around if it is to have any chance of scoring a decisive victory in the
next round. <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp546.htm">Israel, not Hizb&#8217;allah, must dominate the escalation
cycle</a>. Failing to take this lesson to
heart will only further whet the Islamic world&#8217;s appetite for Israel&#8217;s
demise, which more and more voices are saying is just around the corner
after the debacle in Lebanon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan&#8217;s anti-Semitic core apparently prevents him from taking a
rational cause-and-effect view of hostilities between Israel and its
Arab enemies. Twice did Annan <a href="http://www.axcessnews.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=10966">publicly
blast</a>
Israel for &#8220;violating&#8221; a UN-imposed ceasefire by sending IDF commandos
Saturday to disrupt Syrian arms shipments to Hizb&#8217;allah. > &#8220;All such
violations of Security Council resolution 1701 endanger the peace in the
region that was reached after much talk and time,&#8221; Annan said in an
official statement released at UN Headquarters in New York. Of course,
the Israeli raid was a <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About%20the%20Ministry/MFA%20Spokesman/2006/MFA-%20IDF%20Bekaa%20operation%20in%20response%20to%20violation%20of%20cease-fire%2020-Aug-2006.htm">reaction to
something</a>
- an arms shipment that was itself a flagrant violation of the
ceasefire. The agreement provides Israel the right to defend itself,
which includes thwarting enemy efforts to rearm with the kinds of
missiles that pounded northern Israel for 34 days. Common sense provides
Israel the right to defend itself in such cases. Only people like Annan,
with a deep (perhaps subconscious) hatred for the Jewish state, would
purposely turn a blind eye to violations by the Islamic enemy, while
attacking Israel for exercising its legitimate right to self defense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having been on the frontlines of or in a position of national leadership
during every one of Israel&#8217;s major and minor wars with the Arab world,
Ariel Sharon was largely recognized as the father of the Jewish state&#8217;s
doctrine of strategic deterrence. But Sharon was the last of his
generation, and today&#8217;s leaderhip appears more concerned with perceived
diplomatic successes than with maintaining that deterrence. Many will
rightly argue that Sharon himself seriously eroded that deterrence when
he surrendered the Gaza Strip. While the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; suffered serious
losses during the &#8220;intifada,&#8221; the only outcome they will remember is the
withdrawal of ever single Jew from Gaza. In fact, it led them to vote
overwhelmingly for Hamas to lead the Palestinian Authority. That serious
violation of the doctrine of strategic deterrence notwithstanding, most
also realize that faced with a cross-border act of war, like Hizb&#8217;allahs
assault on northern Israel on July 12, Sharon would have understood
better than today&#8217;s leader the importance of a swift, crushing action
against the Lebanese terror group. Was Hizb&#8217;allah, as Prime Minister
Olmert claims, surprised by the initial ferocity of Israel&#8217;s response?
Probably. Did Hizb&#8217;allah pay a price for its aggression? Yes. Was it a
serious price? Perhaps. Will it keep Hizb&#8217;allah from daring to try such
a thing against Israel for the next decade? Not a chance. Israel&#8217;s old
war heroes - at least those in positions of national leadership - are
gone. It is difficult for those in power today, most of who have not
fought in a full-scale war, to understand in the way their predecessors
did the seriousness of the existential threat facing Israel. As Israel&#8217;s
enemies become increasingly bold in their approach, we can probably
expect the new generations of Israeli leadership to rely every more
heavily on hoped for diplomatic achievements in war, rather than
outright victory. The upside is that this phenomenon will eventually
lead this people to call upon a Higher Power to bring them the sought
after victory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a lot of whining going on about those poor Lebanese civilians
whose lives Israel shattered for no apparent reason (if the mainstream
media is to be believed). <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/views/9040.htm">This excellent
editorial</a> helps to put the
whole situation in perspective. I want to just post a few of the points
here, though you really should read the whole thing. The author makes
the point most of the media is ignoring as it shows the scenes of
&#8220;wanton Israeli destruction&#8221; - that is if the Lebanese, or any nation
for that matter, allow a major terrorist organization to set itself up
as a virtual army and then attack a neighboring state, there can be no
claims of ignorance, surprise or innocense when the aggrieved come
roaring back with their own military response. But, he goes on, the
media is purposely ignoring this aspect of the conflict, purposely
ignoring the cause and only looking at the effect, knowing full well
that scenes of pitiful Lebanese families will cause most to forget about
everything but the Israeli bombs that created this situation. He uses
this analogy to illustrate: > Seeing television snippets of wounded or
dead Lebanese with people sitting on the ground crying and calling them
all &#8220;innocent civilians&#8221; is the same as looking at a photograph of the
armpit of Christie Brinkley and saying, &#8220;Here is the photo of a
supermodel. Isn&#8217;t she beautiful?&#8221; > > The armpit picture is only a
part of the story. When human beings see babies or mothers hurting, no
matter what, we feel the pain. If we saw baby pictures of Charles
Manson, we would want to cuddle him. The bottom line for the Lebanese:
> You sleep with dogs, you wake up with fleas. You sleep with missiles,
you wake up dead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s many wars and mini-wars have several things in common. The same
Muslim foe (though often wearing different masks), Israel&#8217;s unfortunate
total reliance (at least for now) on the power of the IDF to win the
day, and a deep national sense that even if to the rest of the world the
battle appears to be nothing more than a border skirmish, much more is
really at stake. Another thing they all have in common is the
inevitability that the United Nations, Europe and even the United States
will at some point accuse Israel of employing &#8220;disproportionate force.&#8221;
The argument, however, seems to be bereft of all logic, especially
coming from the US, where the doctrine of &#8220;overwhelming force&#8221; is the
cornerstone of today&#8217;s military tactics. At the Pentagon they understand
that unless one side or the other is capable of employing force
disproportionate to that of its enemy and actually does so, then there
can be no victory. The status quo would be maintained in perpetuity, or
at least until the Muslims&#8217; were capable of launching a first strike
that left Israel largely unable to respond. The West today owes its
freedom to the fact that no one was holding back America and Britain
from employing &#8220;disproportionate force&#8221; against the Nazis and Imperial
Japan during World War II. Likewise, it is in everyone&#8217;s best interest
that Israel be permitted to truly defeat the forces of Islamic terror
and tyranny surrounding it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The world has entrusted the success of a ceasefire, the basis for peace
and stability between Israel and Lebanon, to the Hizb&#8217;allah terrorist
organization. No one should have to explain why this is a bad idea,
especially after a similar decision to put regional stability in the
hands of Yasser Arafat and his PLO failed so miserably. Everyone
recognizes that the conditions for a future flare-up will exist until
Hizb&#8217;allah disarms, and UN Security Council Resolution 1701 seems to
acknowledge that. But it seems the terror group has been left to decide
for itself whether or not to lay down its arms and allow peace to
prevail. No one - not international peacekeepers and not the Lebanese
army - wants to actually confront Hizb&#8217;allah militarily in order to make
sure it disarms. Hizb&#8217;allah says its disarmament is an internal Lebanese
issue, and so the government of Fuad Siniora tried to hold a government
meeting on the matter Monday morning. But Hizb&#8217;allah <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/750015.html">refused to even
discuss</a> laying down
its arms, and, unsurprisingly, Siniora immediately folded and called off
the meeting. Will that be the end of the charade? Will the international
community view that as a legitimate attempt to implement UN resolutions
regarding Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s arms, and simply throw up its hands in defeat?
There is one force willing to do the job, but apparently the world will
not countenance having Israel actually defeat an Arab Muslim entity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading through UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and Caroline Glick&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525859901&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">pointed
analysis</a>
of it leaves little room for doubt that Israel did not obtain victory in
this fight. The shame of it is that victory could probably have been
obtained quite easily. Or at least far more easily than in Israel&#8217;s
previous wars. You see, Israel did not need to conquer and hold
territory, it did not even have to eliminate Hizb&#8217;allah or its
infrastructure. All Israel had to do was employ a little something the
Americans like to call &#8220;Shock &amp; Awe&#8221;. We saw a little bit of the effect
such an approach can have in the opening days of this war, when the Arab
nations and the international community, believing Israel had loosed all
restraints, initially placed all blame on Hizb&#8217;allah and urged the
terror group to just give Israel back its abducted soldiers and so end
the fighting. Had Israel built on that, had it immediately sent 20,000
troops roaring across southern Lebanon to the Litani, had it from the
very hour after Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s unprovoked act of aggression unleashed an
unprecedented aerial bombardment of Lebanon, then militarily defeating
Hizb&#8217;allah would not have been necessary. The terror group, its
sponsors, and its supporters would have been instilled with such fear
that they would not have dared to attempt such an assault on Israel
again for at least the next 10 years. All Israel had to do to win this
war was instill fear in Hizb&#8217;allah. It failed to do so. Only an
elementary mind would even entertain the idea that Hizb&#8217;allah - still
capable of raining death down on northern Israel and killing great
numbers of IDF soldiers on the battlefield - views itself as having
suffered a defeat. Only an elementary mind would believe Hizb&#8217;allah is
now afraid to ever try such a thing again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Make no mistake about it, as things currently stand, Israel has lost its
war with Hizb&#8217;allah. Despite Defense Minister Amir Peretz&#8217;s ludicrous
announcement Sunday that Israel has won the war, not one single stated
military objective has been met. Two Israeli soldiers are still in
captivity, Hizb&#8217;allah is demonstrating once again today that it is still
very capable of pounding northern Israel, and IDF troops and armor are
being taken out in worrying numbers by a well-armed and highly-trained
enemy. Some in Israel will point to the terms of the UN-imposed
ceasefire, which calls for Hizb&#8217;allah to withdraw north of the Litani
River, as an achievement. But who is naive enough to believe the
terrorists will really withdraw? Or that a sympathetic French-led force
and the Shi&#8217;ite-dominated Lebanese army will actually enforce that
stipulation? No. Israel has lost. And Hizb&#8217;allah knows it. More
concerning, the wider Muslim world knows it. For decades Israel&#8217;s
deterrence was based on the Arabs&#8217; belief that the IDF was simply too
powerful to be beaten. But this conflict, which saw a small band of
terrorists use easily-obtained anti-tank missiles to inflict crushing
losses on a mighty military machine, has ended that myth. Israel, so
long as it fights by the world&#8217;s rules, can be beat. That lesson will
not be lost on the Arabs and Iranians the next time they decide to pick
a fight. And it won&#8217;t be long before they do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Senior Israeli lawmaker Ephraim Sneh, a prominent figure in defense
circles, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/8/9/93736.shtml?s=lh">made the
assessment</a>
this week that Israel will inevitably have to fight Iran sometime in the
near future. But the Jerusalem Post Thursday <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525841985&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">made the
observation</a>
that Israel is already fighting Iran, and Lebanon is the battlefield.
Hizb&#8217;allah is in effect a brigade of Iranian commandoes, Tehran&#8217;s
vanguard forces in its quest to see Israel, in the words of President
Ahmadinejad, &#8220;wiped off the map.&#8221; That fact makes Israel&#8217;s need to deal
Hizb&#8217;allah a decisive defeat all the more pressing. For Israel to not
emerge victorious in this fight will signal victory for Hizb&#8217;allah,
regardless of how many terrorists are killed, and provide Iran with
encouragement and valuable information on how future battles against the
Jewish state should be conducted.</p>
