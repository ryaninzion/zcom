  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel could have made up for its failure to execute an effective battle
plan during last summer&#8217;s Second Lebanon War with a bit of persistence,
rather than jumping at the first opportunity for a ceasefire, a
Hizballah field commander has admitted. In an interview aired on
Israel&#8217;s Channel 10 News Tuesday, the Hizballah officer said the group&#8217;s
forces in southern Lebanon were <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1185893683874&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">dangerously close to having to
surrender</a>
when the UN stepped in with a ceasefire deal last year. > &#8220;The
ceasefire acted as a life jacket for the organization [at the end of the
Second Lebanon War],&#8221; the Hizballah officer said. > > In the
interview, the unnamed officer said Hizbullah gunmen would have
surrendered if the fighting last summer had continued for another 10
days. > > &#8230; > > The officer shown on Channel 10 said the
organization&#8217;s gunmen had been running low on food and water and facing
rapidly diminishing arms supplies. Despite having promised his nation a
crushing defeat of Hizballah, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert readily
accepted the truce, as numerous operational blunders and a mounting
casualty count were making him unpopular. So I guess you can say that
the international community saved Hizballah from destruction with
Olmert&#8217;s help. And I thought he wanted to defeat the terrorists. Just
goes to show you - never trust a politician.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seemingly intent on facilitating Israel&#8217;s ultimate demise, Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert this week <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123228">approved the immigration to Judea and
Samaria of 41 Iraqis of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
descent</a>.
Critics rightly pointed out that Olmert had singlehandedly shattered
Israel&#8217;s opposition to the so-called Palestinian &#8220;right of return.&#8221; The
Palestinians demand that as part of any final status peace agreement,
Israel open its gates to some five million Arabs descended from Arabs
who fled the newly reborn Israel at the behest of their leaders during
the 1948 Middle East war. The &#8220;right of return&#8221; is a critical component
of Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; long-term plans to demographically destroy the Jewish
state, a scheme that he inherited from his deceased mentor, Yasser
Arafat. Israel has successfully rejected that demand for decades, and
even gained the support of the US and other Western powers in regards to
that issue. But now that an Israeli leader has voluntarily compromised
on the &#8220;right of return,&#8221; it will be extremely difficult, if not
impossible, for future Israeli negotiators to counter such demands. To
make matters worse, it was also revealed this week that Olmert is
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1185789796466&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">holding secret final status talks with
Abbas</a>,
despite the fact that the Palestinians have still never complied with
their original commitment to eliminate the threat of anti-Israel
Palestinian terrorism. Now, Olmert is not a stupid man. A prime minister
who manages to hold on to power despite an unprecedented rash of
government corruption, major security blunders and almost no popularity
among the general public and the members of his own party cannot be a
clueless man. But he can be short-sighted and self-serving, and both of
those traits form the necessary foundation for the two possible
explanations for Olmert&#8217;s behavior: 1. Olmert believes that if he throws
every possible concession at the Palestinians something is bound to
&#8220;stick&#8221; and enable him to sign a final status &#8220;peace&#8221; agreement, thereby
cementing his legacy as a &#8220;successful&#8221; peacemaker (this, I believe, is
the same thing driving Bush&#8217;s decisions); 2. Olmert is trying to set the
stage so that what everyone believes is Netanyahu&#8217;s inevitable return to
power will be marked by catastrophe and surrender. By making
precedent-setting concessions and prematurely engaging in final status
talks, Olmert is all but ensuring that Netanyahu will have no choice but
to continue on the same path. The second explanation ultimately leads to
the first. Olmert&#8217;s motivation for discrediting Netanyahu would be to
make himself appear to be a stronger and more capable leader than he
really is, paving the way for his own future return to power. Sadly,
such selfish conniving is definitely not beyond Israel&#8217;s current crop of
leaders. Pray for God to quickly raise up a David to lead this nation,
whether it be Netanyahu or somebody else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An open letter urging President Bush to press forward with the creation
of &#8220;Palestine&#8221; was signed by 30 prominent American Evangelical Christian
leaders at the weekend, indicating that replacement theology remains a
problem even among &#8220;born again&#8221; believers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/us/evangelical_letter.html">The
letter</a>,
which was published in the _New York Times_, also sought to squash the
belief that all Evangelical Christians support Israel&#8217;s biblical right
to every inch of land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean
Sea. > We affirm your [Bush&#8217;s] clear call for a two-state solution. We
also write to correct a serious misperception among some people
including some US policy-makers that all American Evangelicals are
opposed to a two-state solution and creation of a new Palestinian state
that includes the vast majority of the West Bank. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Reading the letter in its entirety, it is clear
that these Christian leaders are approaching the conflict from a
&#8220;do-good-to-all-people&#8221; point of view, and have completely disregarded
those parts of their bibles where God says the land belongs to Israel
and is not to be divided. The only explanation for that position is
Replacement Theology. These Christian leaders apparently do not believe
modern Israel is the same as the Israel of the Bible, even if they do
recognize the Jews as the descendants of that ancient nation. These
types believe that every biblical prophecy regarding present or future
events that include the word &#8220;Israel&#8221; should actually read &#8220;the Church&#8221;
- as if God and the prophets He spoke through somehow made a typo.
Christians United for Israel (CUFI) director Pastor John Hagee <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1185379029387&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">shot
back</a>
by insisting the authors of the letter do not represent mainstream
Evangelical beliefs, and was adamant that most Bible-believing
Christians do support Israel&#8217;s right to the land as a matter of divine
mandate. I hope Hagee is right, but after seeing some of the signatures
attached to that letter, I am not so sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Palestinian terror groups are threatening to assassinate
recently-appointed Fatah Prime Minister Salaam Fayad for making the
smallest of concessions in his recent policy platform statement, further
proving why a real peace deal will never be concluded between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority. Friday&#8217;s publication of the Fayad
government&#8217;s positions <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1185379018232&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">angered Palestinian militants and their
supporters among the general
public</a>
due to the absence of the term &#8220;armed struggle&#8221; when referring to the
conflict with Israel. Instead, the statement merely said that the
Palestinians should continue to engage in &#8220;popular resistance against
the Israeli occupation.&#8221; I am sure they will find a way to argue that
&#8220;popular resistance&#8221; also includes suicide bombings and other
atrocities. Back on topic - Hamas, Islamic Jihad and some PLO groups
responded by declaring that Fayad and his government do not represent
them, and that they will continue to implement their own policies, which
include the murder and maiming of Jewish men, women and children
wherever they can be found. A spokesman for the umbrella group Popular
Resistance Committees summed up the situation thus: > The Palestinians
and their resistance movements and thousands of prisoners will always
have their own platform. No one will be able to spoil our real platform.
The Israeli enemy has failed over the past decades to end the armed
struggle, and Fayad won&#8217;t succeed in doing so. What Israeli and American
officials are willfully turning a blind eye to is the fact that this man
is right. These terror groups will continue to attack Israelis despite
any hint of moderation shown by Fayad, and no one will do anything to
stop them. The real test of moderation is not whether the Palestinian
leadership is willing to put down its own guns, but whether it is
willing to actually protect Israeli lives by preventing any and all of
its citizens from carrying out acts of terror. PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas
has failed that test miserably, and at this point, there is no reason to
believe Fayad will do any better, nor that he desires to. Yasser Arafat
was the master of this game, feigning moderation and engaging in
negotiations that resulted in major Israeli concessions, all while Hamas
and &#8220;rogue&#8221; elements of his own Fatah continued to kill Jews. That
Jerusalem and Washington have jumped in bed with Fayad before he has
proven himself to be at all committed to real peace - the kind where
Jews no longer die for residing in their ancient biblical homeland -
reveals the true depth of the self-serving, short-sighted hypocrisy that
governs the steps of our leaders.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli prime ministers are able to increase their public backing by
concluding even minor compromise agreements with the Arabs, but the
mainstream media and world leaders are 100% mistaken in asserting that
such deals provide long-term political traction for Palestinian leaders.
This misguided line of thinking featured once again in a _Ha&#8217;aretz_
story published on Wednesday regarding Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s
offer to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/886022.html">negotiate an &#8220;Agreement of Principles&#8221; toward the
establishment of a Palestinian
state</a> with PLO leader
Mahmoud Abbas. The leftist newspaper maintained that such an agreement,
which Israel hopes and assumes would be based on mutual compromise,
would &#8220;offer both Abbas and Olmert domestic political gains, and the
Palestinian leader will be able to use it as part of his reelection
campaign.&#8221; It is hard to understand why after more than a decade of the
&#8220;peace&#8221; process these guys still don&#8217;t get it. Abbas cannot go back to
the Palestinian public without 100% of their demands being met. It is
what he has been promising them for years, and it is what the
Palestinian education system is teaching Palestinian children must be
extracted from the &#8220;criminal and blood-thirsty Jews&#8221; <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/23/unchecked-abuse-of-palestinian-children">one way or
another</a>.
The Palestinians have been conditioned by their leadership to accept no
compromise, so you can be sure that same leadership will never conclude
the peace process without having all of its demands met in full. That is
precisely the reason Yasser Arafat turned down Ehud Barak&#8217;s final status
deal at Camp David in 2000. Arafat knew that the little bit of
compromise Barak was asking him to make would ultimately be unacceptable
to the Palestinians, and definitely would not help him in retaining his
dictatorial powers. Going down this path of folly, it seems the best
Israel can hope for is a bilateral agreement that does include some
degree of Palestinian compromise over the land, but which will without
doubt justify in the minds of the Palestinians a continuation of the
&#8220;resistance.&#8221; Israel will get its piece of paper, and the Palestinians
will get most of &#8220;their&#8221; land, but the attacks will continue. Abbas will
claim he is at peace with Israel, but that he simply cannot control or
contain the Hamas rogue in his midst. Arafat permitted the establishment
of Hamas for just such a purpose - so that he could pretend to be
engaged in meaningful peace talks with Israel, while anti-Jewish
Palestinian terrorism continued unabated. This is what Israel&#8217;s current
leadership and the international forces influencing it are offering
Israelis.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is not even a challenge any more to find daily examples of the
international community&#8217;s hypocrisy when it comes to the Israeli-Arab
conflict. Today we hear that Lebanese military forces have <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123171">razed a
Palestinian &#8220;refugee camp&#8221; in their country and killed an untold number
of people</a>. The
world&#8217;s response? Nada. Contrast this to the flood of shrill responses
from the mainstream press, world leaders and the United Nations every
time Israel unintentionally killed a Lebanese civilian during last
summer&#8217;s war against Hizballah. Or imagine if the Israeli army was fully
besieging a Palestinian &#8220;refugee camp&#8221; in Gaza or the so-called &#8220;West
Bank&#8221;? Actually, we have an example of precisely what would happen.
During the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, the IDF launched a major
sustained operation in a very small corner of the northern Samaria town
of Jenin. A few buildings used by terrorists as cover were razed, and 52
Palestinians, the vast majority of them armed militants, were killed.
Israel was accused by the world, repeatedly and without mercy, of
committing a massacre. Apparently, it is only permitted to militarily
pound a community harboring terrorist forces if you are _not_ the
Jewish state. Anti-Semitism, anyone? When you look at it, there is no
way this can all be attributed to ignorance, forgetfulness or anything
else. It requires a conscious decision to hold Israel to a double
standard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was surprised this morning to see campaign posters for Likud Party
leader Binyamin Netanyahu on most of the public buses I passed on my way
to work, considering that at present, the next general election is
scheduled to take place in 2010. That&#8217;s two-and-a-half years from now,
which is _way_ earlier than Israeli politicians usually start their
national election campaigns. It is true that the Likud Party is holding
a primary election in about three weeks, but Netanyahu&#8217;s challengers
(Moshe Feiglin and Danny Danon) have no realistic chance of victory. Add
to that the fact that the Likud only has about 150,000 voting members.
Netanyahu could not be spending so much money on a national campaign
ultimately targeting a very small number of voters for an election he is
certain to win anyway. And then there is the slogan printed on the
posters: &#8220;Israel chooses to succeed!&#8221; Clearly a national election-type
slogan. Either Netanyahu is gambling that somehow the Olmert government
is going to fall in the coming months, or he knows something the rest of
us don&#8217;t about the current prime minister&#8217;s imminent demise. Meanwhile,
Bush is <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/18/did-bush-propose-summit-to-save-olmert">doing his part to ensure Olmert remains in
power</a>
until as many Jews as possible are removed from Judea and Samaria.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The indoctrination of Palestinian Arab children to hate and seek to
destroy the Jews living in this area is, again, <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/17/indoctrination-of-death">nothing
new</a>. It is
an ongoing violation of Israel&#8217;s agreements with the Palestinians that
the rest of the world is content to ignore. Nevertheless, every time I
am presented with the latest example of this wicked treatment of
impressionable young minds, my anger rises afresh. What got my blood
boiling this time was Sunday&#8217;s report by <a href="http://pmw.org.il/">Palestinian Media
Watch</a> (PMW) concerning the newest episode of the
Hamas children&#8217;s program _Tomorrow&#8217;s Pioneers_, which was previously
hosted by Farfur the Mouse, who earlier this month was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9lL81QhiR8">shown being
beaten to death</a> by an
Israeli security agent. In the episode broadcast over the weekend on
Hamas&#8217; Al Aqsa TV, Farfur&#8217;s replacement, Nahool the Bee, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tneSE6nJiLw">tells his
young audience</a> that together
they will &#8220;liberate the sad Al-Aqsa [the mosque that occupies
Jerusalem&#8217;s Temple Mount] that is waiting for us. Yes, we will liberate
Al-Aqsa from the filth of the criminal Jews, who killed my grandfather,
and killed Farfur.&#8221; Later in the show, a young caller says she wants to
be a journalist when she grows up. Nahool encourages her to &#8220;photograph
the Jews when they are killing Farfur and the little children.&#8221; In a
previous episode immediately following Farfur&#8217;s &#8220;martyrdom,&#8221; the show&#8217;s
other host, a young girl named Saraa, confirms for a three-year-old
caller that the &#8220;Jews&#8221; were in fact behind Farfur&#8217;s murder, and that
they are &#8220;criminals and enemies&#8221; who must be expelled from the land. PMW
noted that the number of young Palestinians calling in to the show to
assail the Jews is evidence that the indoctrination efforts are having
the desired effect. What I want to point out is the constant use of the
word &#8220;Jews&#8221; instead of &#8220;Israelis.&#8221; Hamas, Hizballah, Iran, Syria, etc
all constantly state that they have no problem with the Jews per se, but
rather with the &#8220;Zionists&#8221; and the &#8220;Zionist entity.&#8221; These children&#8217;s
programs paint a different picture, though. They are teaching children
to hate the Jews as a people, to view all Jews as blood-thirsty
murderers and thieves. It is the same indoctrination that has been going
on for centuries, and which paved the way for the Nazi Holocaust. In
addition to reiterating the utter dismay that I feel as a father when I
see children the same age as my young son being taught such things, I
would also like to again point out the thorough hypocrisy of the
international community. If Israel was allowing any of its citizens to
broadcast such venomous hatred against the Palestinians or Arabs in
general, the international community would be in an uproar. So, why is
no one stopping this from happening in the Palestinian-controlled areas?
The world pretends to care so much about solving the Israeli-Arab
conflict, yet is not lifting a finger to prevent the Palestinians from
training millions of children to perpetuate it indefinitely. Truly, we
live in a sick and twisted world.</p>

strengthening alliance between Iran, Syria, Hizballah and Hamas, while
continuing to let Israel&#8217;s enemies know that his government is ready and
willing to surrender even more land. Late last week, Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad met in Damascus with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad,
as well as Hizballah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and locally-based
Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal. A number of Arab press reports indicated
that the Muslim leaders agreed on a strategic alliance against the
Jewish state, including arms transfers from Iran to Syria and the terror
groups. Olmert&#8217;s response was to <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3428116,00.html">close his
eyes</a>. An
official in his office told Ynet: > We doubt the credibility of the
[reports] regarding a possible arms deal between Iran and Syria. The
reports must be authenticated. As if it is difficult to conceive of a
strategic anti-Israel alliance and associated arms trade between these
enemies of the Jewish state. Sadly, Israel has a history of ignoring
what the Arabs say to each other in Arabic, while focusing solely on
what they say for Western consumption. And so, Olmert on Sunday declared
his readiness to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184766023371&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">enter into direct negotiations with
Assad</a>,
whose earlier statements about desiring &#8220;peace&#8221; the Israeli leader
apparently took seriously. Olmert even appeared to drop Israel&#8217;s
previous demand that Syria end its support for Hamas and Hizballah
before talks begin. But Olmert didn&#8217;t stop there. The prime minister
went on to berate those who believe Israel can retain control of its
biblical heartland, and insisted that for the sake of maintaining a
Jewish majority and thereby guaranteeing Israel&#8217;s future, Jews must be
removed from Judea and Samaria. Olmert suggested, despite all evidence
to the contrary, that such a withdrawal in the framework of peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, would bring peace and security to
Israel. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, Olmert then admitted that
post-disengagement Gaza could very well become the next southern
Lebanon, but said he will not take military action to prevent that. It
is almost as if this guy is purposely doing everything possible to harm
Israel from a diplomatic and military standpoint. Olmert has either
willfully blinded himself to reality, or his incredible lust for his own
name and legacy knows no bounds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Providing further evidence of why this government needs to go and go
now, Israeli Education Minister Yuli Tamir on Sunday <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184766029464&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">approved a
third-grade history
book</a>
to be used in Arab schools that portrays the Jewish state&#8217;s rebirth in
1948 as a &#8220;catastrophe.&#8221; Israel has for decades been battling the
negative Arab perception of its reestablishment as a nation-state, which
is part of a larger global effort to delegitimize Israel&#8217;s very
existence. In yet another example of unbelievable shortsightedness, the
Olmert government sees fit to contrast the international _hasbara_
(information) campaign with the further indoctrination of young Israeli
Arabs with an ideology that will ultimately lead them to work against
Israel. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t seem to be any closer to early elections
than we were a year ago, and now it appears Bush is <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/18/did-bush-propose-summit-to-save-olmert">doing his
part</a>
to ensure Olmert and his government remain in power. A tremendous amount
of prayer is needed to get these guys out of office and prevent them
from doing any more irreversible harm to Israel.</p>
