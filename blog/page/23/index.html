  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is a practice most in the West cannot comprehend. That a government
would openly take action that causes the death and suffering of is own
people is truly vile. But it is also entirely common in the Muslim
Middle East, especially when propaganda points are on the table. Over
the past two weeks, thousands of Palestinian Arabs have been stranded in
Egyptian Sinai, unable to reenter the Gaza Strip. They have been living
without shelter and an organized supply of food and water. Eight have
died as a result of the conditions. The Palestinian Authority and its
co-conspirators in the international media would have us believe Israel
is holding the gates shut, purposely creating this humanitarian
situation. But none other than a small group of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists
were kind enough to show us the truth Thursday, when they attacked the
PA Presidential Guard soldiers who are keeping the border closed. Now,
it is true that they are keeping it closed because Israel has demanded
such action in order to prevent its abducted soldier from being taken
out of Gaza. But Israel has also tried to alleviate the humanitarian
situation by opening another border crossing - one which can be better
monitored by Israel. Naturally, the PA rejected the offer, preferring to
see its own people die than let the Jews do something to help them. More

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The ongoing flare-up with Hizb&#8217;allah could not have come at a better
time for Israel. Israel has a unique opportunity to deal decisively with
both Hizb&#8217;allah and the Assad regime in Syria with little or no threat
of military intervention by other regional powers. Egypt&#8217;s Hosni Mubarak
is highly unlikely to lead his nation into battle against Israel on
behalf of Syria, as he is old, weak, and heavily beholden to American
financial and military aid. Of course, we all know that thanks to the
Americans, Saddam Hussein is no longer a threat. And with US forces in
Iraq and Afghanistan sandwiching Iran, even madman Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
is unlikely to attack Israel and give Washington the excuse it has
sought to abruptly end his quest to <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2006/07/08/why-august-22">pave the
way</a> for the 12th Imam.
This may be just the opportunity Israel and the US have been waiting for
to eliminate two of the biggest threats to regional stability. It should
not be wasted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it has been so long since the so-called &#8220;Oslo&#8221; Accords were
signed that the Palestinian Authority forgot it agreed not to conduct
foreign relations. Article IX, Item 5.a of the Israeli-Palestinian
Interim Agreement clearly states: > In accordance with the DOP, the
Council [Palestinian Authority] will not have powers and
responsibilities in the sphere of foreign relations, which sphere
includes the establishment abroad of embassies, consulates or other
types of foreign missions and posts or permitting their establishment in
the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, the appointment of or admission of
diplomatic and consular staff, and the exercise of diplomatic functions.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was sounding an awful lot like US
President George W. Bush Wednesday night when he announced his cabinet
had given a green light to the IDF to crush the Hizb&#8217;allah threat.
Israel&#8217;s military chiefs expect Hizb&#8217;allah to respond by unleashing its
massive arsenal of medium and long-range missiles (obtained with the
help of Syria and Iran) on Israeli population centers and strategic
facilities as far south as the coastal city of Netanya. Nevertheless,
Olmert <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/961">boldly declared</a>: > &#8220;We
will confront the threat with determination and we will win this battle.
This is not an easy test for the leadership, for security forces or for
Israeli citizens,&#8221; but &#8220;&#8230;there are times when the state needs to
protect its citizens, even at the price of the rocket threat or
international tensions.&#8221; A far cry from the man who just one year ago
said: > &#8220;We are tired of fighting, we are tired of being courageous, we
are tired of winning, we are tired of defeating our enemies, we want to
be able to live in an entirely different environment of relations with
our enemies.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope the transformation continues until Israel too
has the kind of terror-fighting, international condemnation-deflecting,
cowboy of a leader as the one occupying the White House.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UN chief Kofi Annan wasted no time in &#8220;condemning without reservation&#8221;
Israel&#8217;s military response to Wednesday&#8217;s Hizb&#8217;allah assault that left
seven Israelis dead, eight wounded, and two as captives of the Lebanese
terrorists. While Annan did insist on the immediate release of the
abducted Israelis, he <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1966747,00.html">notably
failed</a>
to explicitly condemn the Hizb&#8217;allah raid as he had the Israeli
counter-action. Annan was unsurprisingly joined by a chorus of other
world leaders <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885978985&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">urging
Israel</a>
to &#8220;show restraint,&#8221; act in a &#8220;moderate and proportionate&#8221; manner, and
not &#8220;seek an eye for an eye&#8221; following the unprovoked aggression against
its citizens. But they once again failed to offer a viable alternative
to overwhelming Israeli force, apparently believing their own toothless
demands would be heeded by Hizb&#8217;allah. Hizb&#8217;allah is not going to
release the Israelis because the world tells it to, just as it clearly
is not going to disarm as the world told it to. And allowing the
international community to broker another prisoner exchange between
Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah will certainly encourage additional abductions. In
the absence of a viable alternative, the world would do well to let
Israel pursue the one course of action that will best prevent a repeat
of today&#8217;s events: the annihilation of Hizb&#8217;allah.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The ongoing Arab aggression and IDF counter-terrorist operations in and
around Gaza have sparked a revolt of sorts within Israel&#8217;s Kadima Party
against the unilateral withdrawal policies of Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert. Israel unilaterally vacated Gaza just 10 months ago, amid
government promises that the move would result in increased security and
stability for the nation. But since then terrorism has been on the rise
and the ability of Gaza-based terrorists to strike distant parts of
sovereign Israel with long-range weapons has increased exponentially.
Some senior members of Kadima, which featured a pullout from Judea and
Samaria as a central plank in its election platform, are starting to
wake up from the fantasy. > &#8220;Considering what is happening in Gaza,
opposition to the realignment is growing. &#8230;I don’t believe unilateral
steps should be made,&#8221; said Housing Minister Meir Sheetrit in an
interview with the Knesset Channel. Sheetrit was backed in that regard
by Kadima ministers Gideon Ezra and Ze&#8217;ev Boim. Then there were those
like Justice Minister Haim Ramon, who <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3273710,00.html">continued to
support</a>
Olmert in his determination to implement another withdrawal despite
present circumstances. > &#8220;The realignment and the disengagement [Gaza
pullout] were borne out of the understanding that Israel has no partner
on the other side. The events of the past few days just prove this.
Since Israel can’t be held hostage by Hamas and Kassam rockets, it must
act according to its interests.&#8221; Many are wondering if it is in Israel&#8217;s
interest to give the terrorists the kind of space that has allowed
Gaza&#8217;s &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to launch unprecedented numbers of rockets and
plan and execute sophisticated operations like last month&#8217;s abduction of
IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit. But Olmert and his circle continue to delude
themselves into thinking the Gaza withdrawal actually improved the
security situation, and therefore sets a positve precedent for a further
surrender of &#8220;West Bank&#8221; lands. > &#8220;Today it is clear to all of us,
especially in light of the recent developments in Gaza, that it is much
easier for us to deal with the Kassams when we are out of Gaza. With all
due respect, there were more Kassam-related deaths before the
disengagement. Therefore, these developments only strengthen the notion
of realignment,&#8221; one source close to the prime minister told Ynet.
Interestingly, this official fails to mention that far more rockets are
being fired from Gaza per month since the withdrawal than before. Of
course, the fact they have caused so few casualties has nothing
whatsoever to do with the withdrawal, and is nothing short of
miraculous. Olmert&#8217;s lackey goes on to assert that the recent upgrading
of Kassams by Gaza terrorists and the increasing use of more advanced
projectiles - like the GRAD Katyusha missiles smuggled in after the
IDF&#8217;s departure - are natural evolutions of the conflict that would have
occured whether or not Israel had pulled out. > &#8220;Look at the kassam
that was fired from [the Samarian town of] Tulkarm [Sunday]; we are
there with the entire army and they still manufacture Kassams; it’s an
evolution of this war, and it has nothing to do with whether we are
there or not.&#8221; His glaring omission of the fact that, while a single
rocket was fired from Samaria, more than 1,000 have been launched from
Gaza since January alone was not lost on many. Israel&#8217;s firm presence in
Judea and Samaria has without question prevented the millions living in
Israel&#8217;s populous central regions from having to endure the kind of
artillery bombardments the residents of the Western Negev have sadly
become accustomed to. Fortunately, it appears enough of Israel&#8217;s
politicians are reaching clarity on this issue as to prevent Olmert&#8217;s
plans from every becoming reality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A large portion of Israel&#8217;s Arab population has long applauded,
supported and even participated in &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorism against their
Jewish countrymen. With Israel&#8217;s Arab parliamentarians becoming more and
more bold in their treasonous disdain for Jewish life and Israel&#8217;s
continued survival, that phenomenon can only grow. Balad Party MK Wasil
Taha was <a href="http://israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=106857">recently
caught</a> urging the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; on an online Islamic chat room to focus their attacks on
the IDF, and even to attempt the abduction of Jewish soldiers. > &#8220;We
told them more than once that the Palestinians&#8230;have two options: One
is to explode and kill civilians - and these are much easier operations.
The second option is the military option, in the framework of which a
military unit from the resistance [terrorist groups] is established in
order to break into a military camp, clash with the soldiers and battle
them and take them and the conquest into captivity.&#8221; Now, it is
difficult to determine if Taha&#8217;s advice led directly to IDF Corporal
Gilad Shalit&#8217;s abduction, but the timing seems too close to be a
coincidence. During an interview on Israel Radio Sunday, Taha&#8217;s <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/736292.html">refusal
to retract</a> his
original remarks indicated he would have no problem with his words
acting as the inspiration behind Shalit&#8217;s ongoing terrifying ordeal.
Taha was followed by former MK Abdulmalik Dehamshe of the United Arab
List who
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3272738,00.html">told</a> the
Israel-Arab newspaper _Kul al-Arab_ that &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; rocket attacks,
terrorist abductions and &#8220;suicide&#8221; bombings are &#8220;legitimate and
respected.&#8221; > &#8220;The Palestinians have no other weapons but these rockets
and the suicide bombings &#8230; if it wasn&#8217;t for the suicide bombings – the
Palestinian issue would be dead by now.&#8221; How far do you let &#8220;free
speech&#8221; go before you start hanging people for treason?</p>

is the one desperately looking for a truce - that it&#8217;s forces are
winning the battle in Gaza, and will continue to &#8220;humiliate&#8221; the
Israelis if the IDF is not reined in. Hmmm, let&#8217;s see, 70 dead

who is humiliating whom? It all seems an odd way to seek a cessation of
