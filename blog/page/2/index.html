  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a further follow-up to my earlier post regarding a <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/09/30/arabs-loving-israelis">lovely Arab woman
from northern Israel who loves Israel and the God of Israel with all her
heart</a>, I want
to provide an example of how such servants of the Lord are being
persecuted by their own people. This same woman who just days before
embraced and was embraced by an Israeli Jewish woman from the
rocket-battered town of Sderot was on Monday the target of Israeli-Arab
Muslim aggression in Tel Aviv. As the <a href="http://www.israelmybeloved.com">International Christian Zionist
Center</a> Feast of Tabernacles group
gathered outside Israeli army headquarters in Tel Aviv, we all noticed
the conspicuous presence of an unhappy looking Arab woman in full Muslim
attire. She seemed to be zoning in on the Christian Arab woman with us,
who promptly notified the hovering Israeli security agents (imagine that
- an Arab requesting that Israeli security come investigate another
Arab). After being questioned by a security agent, the Muslim woman made
a beeline for the Christian lady and verbally assaulted her. Refusing to
address her in Arabic, the Muslim accused the Christian of &#8220;being a Jew&#8221;
due to her support of Israel and said she should be ashamed. She then
threatened that &#8220;we know who you are, and we will lay our hands on you.&#8221;
The Christian lady later told us that such confrontations are not
uncommon, and that there are Muslim groups that keep tabs on Arabs like
her to harass and even harm any that dare show love and support for
Israel. That caused me to think about the tremendous amount of courage
demonstrated by Arabs like this amazing woman traveling with us. Sure,
we are putting ourselves in a relative amount of danger by living in
Israel and openly siding with the Jewish state. But the threat to us as
foreign Christians does not even come close to that faced by Middle East
Arabs who throw in their lot with Israel. This particular woman could
very easily keep her mouth shut and remain at home, quietly loving
Israel in her heart, while avoiding the very real and deadly threat
posed to her and her family. But she is a true believer, a true servant
of the Lord, and she knows that she has no choice but to serve the Lord
openly and declare His truth regarding this nation&#8230; even at the cost
of her own life. Pray for this woman, for her family and for the others
like her who love the Lord and the &#8220;apple of His eye&#8221; more than their
own lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to add to my previous post regarding the <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/09/30/arabs-loving-israelis">beautiful love I
witnessed last week between an Israeli Arab mother and an Israeli Jewish
mother</a> in the
battered town of Sderot by noting the lessons I learned at that event
about touching the hearts of Israelis. I am a fairly reserved, though
straight-forward person, so I am not always comfortable in the presence
of dramatic Christian expressions of faith. I will qualify that by
noting that I am not critical of such displays - if God found favor with
David wildly dancing in his underwear in the presence of His ark, then
clearly there is nothing wrong with such behavior. Anyway, since I am
personally perhaps a little too bashful to act out in such a way myself,
I always feared that the Israelis we were visiting during these Feast of
Tabernacles outings were viewing the group as a bunch of
mentally-disturbed nut-jobs. I always feared that instead of providing
comfort, the brightly colored biblical-style clothing, the waving
banners and the chorus of shofars were instead eliciting internal
chuckles of disdain. While a handful of Israelis may indeed view the
Feast groups in such a way, I discovered in Sderot that most, especially
in locations where Israelis are hurting most, are touched to the core by
this bizarre-looking and unfamiliar outpouring of love. As the group
marched down the streets of Sderot, rather than being put off by the
costumes, flags and shofars, Israeli pedestrians were clapping, mothers
were coming out of their homes weeping and motorists blocked by our
procession were honking and cheering. Last Friday I witnessed hundreds
of Israelis being deeply touched, being comforted by hundreds of
Christians that most would write off as “freaks.” (Sadly, I have heard
even fellow believers here in Jerusalem refer to the participants in
this event in such derogatory terms.) So, while donating money to causes
in Israel or saying prayers for the Jewish state are all well and good,
if you want to really, directly touch the hearts of Israelis where they
are, then you need to get to Israel and join these “freaks” as they
bring the love of our Lord to a hurting and thirsty nation. For more

celebration and the International Christian Zionist Center, visit

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I participated in Friday&#8217;s visit to the rocket-battered town of Sderot
by some 500 participants in the International Christian Zionist Center&#8217;s
Feast of Tabernacles celebration. While the group&#8217;s march through the
town and its outpouring of love was beautiful to see, one scene in
particular brought tears to my eyes. As we arrived and the group was
lining up, an Israeli-Arab lady who had come with us went to sit at the
side in an attempt to escape the sun. This lovely Christian woman
suddenly noticed that a local Israeli woman had walked up next to her to
observe the spectacle of so many colorfully-attired Christians forming
up just outside her home. She turned to the Israeli woman and said: >
We have come to stand with you. We love you. I think about what you are
going through and I cannot sleep. Those words, coming from an Arab to an
Israeli Jew, are amazing enough. I then stood nearby and watched and
listened while these two women, these two mothers, one an Arab and the
other an Israeli Jew, held each other and cried. The Christian woman
knew exactly what the Sderot mother was going through, for just one year
earlier her own home was seriously damaged and her own children&#8217;s lives
endangered by Hizballah missiles from Lebanon. This is the kind of love
and coexistence that could exist between all Israelis and their Arab
countrymen and neighbors, if only the Arabs could be brought to the Lord
and freed from Islam and the lie that is the “Palestinian cause.” This
amazing Arab woman is living proof that her people can be staunch
Israel-loving Christian Zionists, sending their own children to fight in
defense of the Jewish state and proudly referring to themselves as
“Israelis.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much is being made of Columbia University&#8217;s decision to let Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad address its student body in the name of
free speech and critical dialogue. Proponents of the decision insist
that the event provided an opportunity to publicly confront the Iranian
regime&#8217;s repression of basic freedoms, denial of the Holocaust and
refusal to accept Israel&#8217;s right to exist in a public forum for all the
world to see. According to this naive thinking, the exchange at Columbia
should have served to expose the fallacy of Ahmadinejad&#8217;s positions,
thereby undercutting his support base and encouraging opposition to his
policies at home. However, it is a near certainty that the portions of
Monday&#8217;s event in which Ahmadinejad was scorned for his views or was
booed and heckled by the audience will never air in Iran. Instead,
Iranian state-controlled television will broadcast those parts of the
event in which their president was loudly applauded by the liberals in
the audience. Those scenes and the very fact that Ahmadinejad was
invited to speak at one of America&#8217;s most prominent universities are
going to provide him with a tremendous amount of prestige and legitimacy
in Iran and the Middle East, and will instead undercut his detractors.
Supporters of having the Tyrant of Tehran at Columbia also say that
American university students must be exposed to the different ideologies
and concepts that are out there, and should not hinder free speech and
the exchange of ideas, regardless of how offensive they may be to our
own sensitivities. Tellingly, Columbia regularly denies the right of
political conservatives to ascend the same platform. As an example of
the depth of Columbia&#8217;s hypocrisy, consider that at Monday&#8217;s event
Ahmadinejad insisted there are no homosexuals in Iran, which is another
way of saying he and his nation&#8217;s religious overlords will not allow
homosexuality in Iran. This position was known beforehand, yet
Ahmadinejad was invited to speak anyway, while recruiters with the US
military&#8217;s ROTC training program are barred from the campus because of
the military&#8217;s “don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell” policy regarding homosexuality.
The worst part about letting Ahmadinejad speak at Columbia University,
however, was that it lent a certain degree of legitimacy to not only the
man, but also to his venomous views. Even if no one at Columbia agreed
with Ahmadinejad regarding his revisionist view of the Nazi Holocaust
and his desire to see Israel destroyed (not to mention his regime&#8217;s
repressive practices at home) allowing him to engage the student body
and the American people at large in dialogue essentially announced that
we consider these topics to be open for discussion. It has been rightly
noted that Columbia is not alone among major American universities in
behaving thus. The combination of naivety and hypocrisy that plagues
Columbia University is increasingly prevalent throughout America
academia, and is like a Trojan Horse opening the doors to our most
dedicated enemies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazingly, after Jews around the world dreamt and prayed for 2,000 years
about returning to Zion and even rebuilding their temple to the
Almighty, an Israeli government is today actively shielding the Muslim
powers that are trying to erase any Jewish connection to Jerusalem&#8217;s
Temple Mount. This past Friday, Israel&#8217;s High Court heard the response
of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s government to an earlier petition by
leading archeologists to have the authorities halt the destructive
excavations and renovations being carried out without supervision by the
Muslim Trust (Waqf) that oversees the Temple Mount. To the shock and
dismay of the archeologists, the judge <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=36126">ordered them out of the
courtroom</a> so that he could be
presented with “secret evidence” by Olmert&#8217;s government “proving” that
the Muslims had caused no damage to any Jewish antiquities. Why would
these archeologists be ordered out of the courtroom unless the
government either didn&#8217;t really have any evidence or the evidence they
did have didn&#8217;t really prove anything? What seems most likely to me is
that the petitioners were ordered out so that the Olmert government
could explain to the judge without any interruptions or objections why
Israel needs to just keep its mouth shut and allow its enemies to
destroy all remains of a historical Jewish connection to the Temple
Mount so as not to disrupt “peace” efforts. Earlier this month, Israeli
television showed footage of the Muslim excavations atop the Temple
Mount. In the footage, a deep and long gash can be seen in the floor of
the compound, revealing at least one ornate ancient wall that experts
say is likely the first piece of the Second Temple to be revealed in
centuries. The wall was smashed during the dig. It is no secret that the
Muslims want to deny any Jewish connection to this most holy place. They
say as much all the time. What is shocking is that a Jewish Israeli
government is going out of its way to shield the Muslims in this
despicable act of rewriting history. A couple weeks ago, the Temple
Institute in Jerusalem called on all Bible-believing Christians to <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/09/06/christians-called-to-help-save-the-temple">rise
up and aid their Jewish brothers in defending the Temple Mount against
the plans of
Allah</a>.
I think it is time we answer that call, since the needed help is clearly
not going to come from Israel&#8217;s own authorities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is no secret to those with their eyes open that even the so-called
“moderate” Palestinians belonging to Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; Fatah movement are
neck-deep in the blood of Israeli Jews and see violence as a useful and
legitimate tool in obtaining its goals. For those still on the fence on
this issue, Fatah commanders themselves are now admitting that their
group employs a strategy of sowing with the gun and reaping with
politics. Earlier this summer, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
decided to grant amnesty to 178 Fatah terrorists as a gesture of
goodwill toward Abbas and in an effort to bolster his fragile regime,
which had recently suffered a stunning military defeat at the hand of
Hamas in Gaza. Israeli and foreign media outlets portrayed the Fatah
members participating in the move as almost repenting of their past
violence and converting to the path of dialogue. The truth, however, is
that these groups - even the “moderate” Fatah and their supporters among
the general public - believe terrorist violence against Israeli Jews is
a necessary component of their overall negotiation strategy. The
Bethlehem-based Ma&#8217;an news agency recently interviewed Abu Jabal, a
local field commander of Fatah&#8217;s Al Aqsa Brigades “military wing” in the
Samarian town of Nablus (biblical Shechem). Abu Jabal, who was among
those granted amnesty, had this to say of the <a href="http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=25171">relationship between
Palestinian violence and
negotiations</a>:
> We have a saying in Fatah: With the gun we plant and with the
politics we harvest. A colleague, Abu Skandar, jumped in on the
interview to point out that the Fatah men did not intend to abide by the
documents they signed renouncing the use of violence against Israelis
forever. > We want to give politicians an opportunity, [but] we have
not absolutely abandoned fighting. Abu Jabal also stressed that he and
his men did not agree to the amnesty deal because they suddenly feel
remorse for attacking Jewish men, women and children, but rather because
doing so presently serves Palestinian interests: > We agreed to this
because it benefits the Palestinian people. This is “moderate” Islam,
this is the behavior of the most moderate Palestinians. It is a mistake
to see news reports of “moderate” Palestinian leaders and assume that
their moderation and behavior mirrors that of moderate folks in the
West. Our leaders in the West, however, are going to great lengths to
ignore that discrepancy. They are putting their own short-term political
interests first by pretending that people like Abbas and Abu Jabal hold
views equal to our own when it comes to terrorist activity. These
leaders refuse to acknowledge Arab admissions of remaining committed to
terrorist violence because doing so would pull the rug out from under
their own political agendas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jimmy Carter this week continued his rise as the new king of the
delusional leftists who insist Israel and the US have no real enemies
besides those they themselves provoke to hostile action. In an address
at Emory University, Carter stated adamantly that it was “almost
inconceivable” that Iran would actually attack Israel, and insisted that
the Islamic Republic does not pose any real threat to either the Jewish
state or the US. <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133509">Said
Carter</a>: >
Iran is quite distant from Israel. Uh, ever heard of ballistic missiles?
> I think it would be almost inconceivable that Iran would commit
suicide by launching one or two missiles of any kind against the nation
of Israel. Ok, so he has heard of ballistic missiles, but apparently
missed the memo that Iran has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1189411419433&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">600 of them pointed at
Israel</a>,
not just two. Unbelievably, this is the same Jimmy Carter who was
president during the Islamic Revolution and the seizing of the US
Embassy in Tehran. And he somehow now finds it impossible to believe
that the same kind of Islamic madmen who perpetrated those crimes would
ever launch an attack on the Islamic world&#8217;s most hated enemy. This is
exactly the kind of delusional wishful thinking that resulted in
British-led Western Europe keeping its eyes tightly closed until
Hitler&#8217;s Germany had actually launched its conquest of the continent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While the Bush Administration pours millions of US taxpayers&#8217; dollars
into the Palestinian Authority in a vain hope that that regime will ever
build and govern a viable state-like entity, the Palestinian Authority
is busy celebrating the victories of America&#8217;s enemies. For those
Americans who believe the Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas is
either moderate or pro-American, take a look at this cartoon that
featured prominently last week in a newspaper fully controlled by Abbas&#8217;
office:
<img src="http://www.zionist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/binladenvictoryoverwtc-alhayat-12-9-2007.JPG" alt="Palestinian political cartoon celebrating Al Qaeda attack on
US" />
\
 The same newspaper has carried similar illustrations ever since Al
Qaeda killers downed the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11,
2001. That shouldn&#8217;t come as too much of a surprise, considering that
the Palestinians erupted in mass street celebrations as the Twin Towers
were burning and falling on top of thousands of Americans that fateful
day. I remember watching television footage of Arabs just a few miles
from me in eastern Jerusalem handing out candy and howling with joy over
the fact that Osama bin Laden had slaughtered so many infidels. And that
feeling of camaraderie with America&#8217;s enemies has clearly not waned. As
recently as 2005, a public opinion poll showed that <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57696">a firm 65 percent
of Palestinian Arabs still supported Al Qaeda&#8217;s assault on the United
States</a>.
That the Palestinian public proudly sees itself as an enemy of the US
can be traced to its leadership, which continues to use all that US and
European money to <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/08/30/someone-stop-the-abuse-of-palestinian-children">educate young Palestinians to hate not only
Israel</a>,
but the entire Judeo-Christian West. Of course, that behavior can be
traced back to Islam, which teaches all Arab Muslims, both the leaders
and the general public, that all non-Muslim entities must ultimately be
warred against and conquered. Should America really be spending its
money in a way that helps forward such a message? Some will argue that
cutting off the aid will wrongfully harm the Palestinian public for the
mistakes of their leaders. But if the money being given to the
Palestinians for education and other social assistance efforts is being
used in such a way that teaches and trains future generations of
Palestinians to hate and seek war, is it really helping them anyway?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Palestinians and the international media do their best to convince
the world that Israel is treating the Gaza Strip in a brutal and
oppressive manner. The truth is that Israel&#8217;s leadership is very
stubbornly refusing to take off its kid gloves in dealing with the
mounting threat from Hamas-controlled Gaza, to the continued detriment
of both Israel and the Arabs of Gaza. On Wednesday, the government of
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made a show of combating the Gaza threat by
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3451149,00.html">dramatically declaring the volatile coastal strip a “hostile enemy
territory.”</a>
It is a move that will accomplish absolutely nothing. Years ago, as
Yasser Arafat&#8217;s uprising against Israel was getting into full swing, the
government of Ariel Sharon declared the terror icon and his regime
enemies of the Jewish state. The decision gained a lot of international
press coverage, as well as a lot of international scorn, while doing
absolutely nothing to slow down the Palestinian terrorist onslaught. The
moment Arafat was dead the international community fully brushed aside
Israel&#8217;s conclusion that the entire Palestinian regime had become
hostile, and insisted that the time had arrived to rush to a final
status peace agreement. Even less effective will be the limited
sanctions the cabinet also approved on Wednesday. The ministers said
they are ready to cut Israel&#8217;s supply of electricity and fuel to Gaza
(can you believe Israel is still providing these things?), but also
rejected the idea of doing anything that would too adversely affect the
civilian population. Well, cutting electricity and fuel will adversely
affect the civilian population in a very visible way, so you can be sure
the reduction of these basic services will be token in scope. The only
effective solution to the Gaza rocket problem is the one that Olmert&#8217;s
cabinet unanimously rejected - a full ground invasion of Gaza and the
possible reinstating of long-term Israeli control. Security and defense
experts, including some of Olmert&#8217;s own ministers, have been warning for
years that the only way to really curb the threat of rockets from Gaza
is to go in with overwhelming force and crush the local terrorist
infrastructure. Those same experts also warn that any alternative move
that does not eliminate the ability of Hamas and other groups to make
war on Israelis will only encourage the terrorists to continue down
their path of violence. Hamas and their terrorist allies do not need to
actually defeat Israel militarily, just as Hizballah did not need to
actually win the war with Israel last summer. They just had to survive
the war with Israel. That a small terrorist militia went to war with the
mighty Israeli army and survived while inflicting damage on Israeli
civilians was enough to boost Hizballah&#8217;s image among the Arab world
immeasurably. Israel is handing Hamas the same type of victory. Nor does
Hamas care about the suffering of the people living under their control.
In fact, the more the local population suffers from Israeli sanctions
and limited military strikes, the more public relations ammunition Hamas
has. If Israel really cares about putting Hamas out of business and
about ending the suffering of the Arabs of Gaza, it should listen to
those experts who advocate crushing, one-time military action that will
end Hamas&#8217; very ability to function and at the same time end the need
for ongoing Israeli military reprisals that inadvertently harm the
civilian population.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The popular Christian magazine _Christianity Today_ recently lent its
support to a letter signed by 34 US Evangelical leaders <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/30/christian-support-for-palestine-smacks-of-replacement-theology">urging
President George W. Bush to continue down his path of dividing the Land
of
Israel</a>.
The magazine then carried an article <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/september/16.24.html">defending its decision to support
that
call</a>.
With all due respect, it appears _Christianity Today_ has, like so
many American churches, allowed secular humanism to creep in and
influence its views on the current conflict. The author of the recent
_Christianity Today_ article says a lot that I can agree with
pertaining to the continued position of the Children of Israel as the
apple of God&#8217;s eye and of the necessity for us as Gentile believers to
realize that we have been grafted into Israel&#8217;s tree of faith. > We
cannot read the New Testament without seeing that the Jews continue to
have a place in God&#8217;s economy. Gentile Christians do not replace the
Jews, but are joint heirs and wild branches grafted onto the Jewish
olive tree. God&#8217;s ultimate purpose in saving Gentile Christians is to
save the Jews (Rom. 11). OK so far, but that is where it starts to break
down for me. The author goes on to suggest that while the Bible may deed
a far greater area of land to Israel than what it today has full
sovereignty over, our Christian obligations toward others forbid us to
support Israel&#8217;s rule over a “Palestinian” population that does not
desire it. > While the most vocal Christian Zionists call for Israel to
possess all of the Davidic “Greater Israel,“ such goals come at too high
a price. The author justifies this position by noting that the majority
of Israelis, even those who do dream of possessing all of the Promised
Land, realize they cannot rule over such a large population of Arabs and
therefore must abandon the hope of a complete fulfillment of God&#8217;s
promises. They must abandon the borders that God Himself drew for Israel
because of the sensitivities and protests of the Muslim world. This is a
very wrong position for a Bible-believer to take. The Israelis who think
this way, even if they are a majority, are failing to fully put their
faith in God and in His promises. We should not be encouraging them to
behave in such a way, and we certainly should not be joining them in
doing so. Fortunately, David Ben Gurion and his contemporaries did not
allow themselves to be influenced by such demographic nonsense and
declared independence despite the Jews being a minority west of the
Jordan River at the time. **Trust in God and in His Word should cause
us to stand firm on His promises even when present circumstances don&#8217;t
appear to be in our favor.** The editors of _Christianity Today_,
while they seem to recognize the continued central importance of Israel
and her restoration in God&#8217;s plans, apparently fail to realize that the
enemy is naturally doing everything in his power to thwart or at least
stall the fulfillment of those plans. That means hindering the
restoration of the land to Israel and of Israel to the land. It is not
wrong to hope and pray for and even try to facilitate a better life for
the Arabs, though their salvation from Islam should be our first
concern. However, by giving succor to the Arab “cause” of dividing and
eventually overrunning the Land of Israel, these Christians are in fact
aiding the schemes of the enemy of our Lord. Another couple of biblical
points I would like to make that contradict the position _Christianity
Today_ has taken are these: 1. The Lord clearly warns against efforts
to divide “My land,” and speaks of severe judgement for those who do
(Joel 3:2). By urging Bush to press on with his “two-state solution,”
these Christians are urging their leader to become one of those the Lord
speaks out against. 2. As Christians, we should recognize that there
will be no peace in the Middle East between Israel and her neighbors
until Messiah returns (Isaiah 2:2, 4) and establishes his rule with an
iron rod (Psalm 2:9). We are called to be peacemakers, but not in a
manner that runs contrary to the rest of God&#8217;s Word and puts us in the
camp of those scorned by the prophets and destined to suffer severe
judgement. That last point speaks to an issue regarding the Church in
America that has bothered me for some time, and that is the fingerprints
of secular humanism that can be seen in so many of the Church&#8217;s views
regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict. God has determined quite clearly
that this land belongs to Him (Leviticus 25:23), and that His intention
is to restore it to Israel (Amos 9:14-15). While God does care about
each of us personally, the fulfillment of our personal desires is far
less important than the fulfillment of His divine will. That the
Palestinian Arabs desire to have their own sovereign nation on this
small piece of land should for us pale in comparison to the expressed
will of God. It is secular humanism that denies Israel its biblical
birthright as a result of Arab whining. Those Arabs refuse to accept the
word, promises and will of God. We should not join them. The
Palestinians&#8217; plight is not rooted in Israel&#8217;s restoration, but rather
in their failure to accept the Lord God of Israel and get in line with
His will. At present, they are pawns of the enemy in his effort to
thwart and hinder God&#8217;s plans. It is wrong for us as Christians to help
keep the Palestinians in this state, when we should be seeking their
salvation from Islam and the clutches of Allah. The position represented
by the editors of _Christianity Today_ and those other Evangelical
leaders who signed that ill-advised letter to Bush is more in line with
politically correct secular humanism than with the Word of God. Also
