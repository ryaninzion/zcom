clarity</a>
regarding Israel&#8217;s &#8220;peace&#8221; process with the Palestinian Arabs. >
&#8220;Israel is proposing to the Palestinians peace according to the road
map. I don’t believe Hamas will change and accept Israel’s conditions
for talks.&#8221; The reason? > &#8220;Hamas is an extremist religious movement.
Under the demands it is being asked, it should become a secular
political party, and I doubt it will implement the demands.&#8221; Here that
world? You are demanding Hamas transform from from an extremist
religious movement into a secular political party - that it renounce its
very core beliefs and adopt yours instead. Just not gonna happen. Peres&#8217;
remarks also indicate recognition that Hamas&#8217; belligerent policies are
rooted in its Islamic faith. Shame Peres didn&#8217;t display this level of
clarity when trying to transform Yasser Arafat from a dedicated and
blood-soaked killer into a diplomat and peace partner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas is incensed over an Israeli missile strike on an
empty building in his presidential compound in Gaza. To hear him speak,
Israel simply launched the attack for fun, because it just loves to see
the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; squirm. > &#8220;The continuous random bombarding in Gaza
is not justified. It wants nothing but to disrupt the daily life of the
Palestinian people.&#8221; So why did Israel launch the strike? Well, Israel
would argue that all those Kassam and Katyusha rockets being fired from
Gaza on a daily basis at Israeli civilians in the Negev are the reason.
To turn Abbas&#8217; accusation on its head - it seems the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; want
nothing but to disrupt the daily life of all Israelis within their
reach. And the fact Abbas and his regime are doing absolutely nothing to
prevent such attacks make them fully complicit. So, far from a &#8220;random
bombardment&#8221; meant to &#8220;disrupt the daily life&#8221; of Gaza&#8217;s residents, a
little cause and effect analysis shows that Tuesday&#8217;s air strike was a
determined action meant to send a message to Abbas over his ongoing
failure to act in accordance with signed agreements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.israpundit.com/2006/wp-trackback.php?p=743">Andrew Jaffee comments at
IsraPundit</a> on a
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498793819&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">Jerusalem Post
story</a>
regarding Europe&#8217;s suggestion that Jerusalem &#8220;lease the settlement blocs
from the Palestinian Authority rather than annex them outright.&#8221;
According to the article: > &#8230;the EU&#8217;s hope would be that Israel
would &#8216;be generous&#8217; and give the PA &#8216;more than the minimum.&#8217; An
incredulous Jaffee responds: > Israel makes up 1/6 of one percent of
the territory of the Middle East, and the Jewish state should &#8220;be
generous&#8221; and give the PA &#8220;more than the minimum?&#8221; There&#8217;s an old
expression: &#8216;One half of nothing is still nothing.&#8217; Israel has
already been generous, giving up Gaza and now planning to give up the
West Bank. Weâre back to square one, where the Arabs, and their EU
supporters, seem bent on demanding that all of little Israel be given
up. I would add that even before the current &#8220;peace&#8221; process,
&#8220;disengagement&#8221; and planned &#8220;convergence,&#8221; the Jews were more than
generous with this land. You see, the Balfour Declaration promised to
the Jews not only all the land between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea to Israel, but also all of what is today the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan - much of which was part of biblical Israel. In 1920,
the Balfour Declaration for all intents and purposes became
international law at the League of Nations&#8217; meeting in San Remo. But
when it came time to seek independence, the Jews did not bring up these
laws, and settled for whatever scrap of land the UN would agree to
recognize Israel on. And that scrap was far smaller than the lands
originally promised. The Jews have already shown more generosity than
any other people would even consider in relinquishing their biblical,
historic, and legal claims to OVER half the land they are entitled to.
And this is why Ehud Olmert&#8217;s &#8220;convergence&#8221; plan is so dangerous, and
should throw up warning signs for all Israelis. If the past century has
taught Israel anything, it should be that no amount of land will ever
assuage its enemies. Hamas appears to be the only party seeing things
clearly when it says: Peace means the elimination of Israel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Hamas&#8217; overwhelming electoral victory in January, the
international media has gone to great lengths to assuage global shock
and dismay over this turn of events by insisting the Palestinian Arabs
voted for the blood-soaked terrorists for purely socio-economic reasons.
The latest example of this self-delusion comes from the pen of chief CNN
Palestinian-apologist Christiane Amanpour, who wrote in a piece titled
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2006/03/from-terrorism-to-trash-collection_28.html">&#8220;From terrorism to trash
collection&#8221;</a>:
> &#8220;During this year&#8217;s election, Palestinians fed up with the rampant
corruption and lawlessness of the late Yasser Arafat&#8217;s government turned
to the only alternative, Hamas.&#8221; This theory, however, was <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC06.php?CID=917">easily
discredited</a>
by analyst Robert Satloff (via
<a href="http://www.honestreporting.com">HonestReporting.com</a>: > &#8220;Other parties
on the ballot offered alternatives to Fatah, including the
good-government Third Way, but Hamas won 74 seats and the squeaky-clean
liberals just 2. Indeed, it is an uncomfortable truth that an absolute
majority of Palestinians voted for parties publicly committed to the
destruction of Israel&#8230; To suggest that Palestinians were oblivious to
the political meaning of their votes is, as President Bush has argued in
a different context, the soft bigotry of low expectations. Even if the
assertions of Amanpour and her colleagues did contain a hint of truth,
it must be remembered that there are many other organizations besides
Hamas providing charitable social services to the Palestinian Arabs -
including the United States government. So why is Washington so hated
and Hamas is popular enough to become the sole ruling part of the
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; legislature? The difference between Hamas and all these
other groups, organizations and governments is one thing - Jewish body
count. Hamas is widely popular - far more so than any other humanitarian
group - precisely because it has combined its social efforts with a
successful campaign of mass murder against Israel&#8217;s Jews. Without the
blood is has spilled, Hamas could not stand out as it does today and
could not have performed such a massive electoral coup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Believe it or not, Ehud Olmert and his Kadima Party are still using the
same, tired argument of some kind of demographic threat to justify
surrendering to the Arabs&#8217; demand that Judea and Samaria be cleansed of
Jews. Senior Kadima member Haim Ramon was confronted by a prominent
leftist journalist this week regarding Olmert&#8217;s dangerous &#8220;convergence
plan&#8221; - which will see Israel retreat and hide behind its security
barrier. > &#8220;I want a division of the land. But I hold that Ehud
Olmert&#8217;s&#8230;unilateral division plan is dangerous. It will lead to the
establishment of an armed and hostile Hamas state that will undercut the
stability of Israel, Jordan and the Middle East&#8230;It will inevitably
lead to war,&#8221; argued Ha&#8217;aretz&#8217;s Ari Shavit. Ramon&#8217;s response was to
regurgitate the threat of an Arab demographic take over between the
Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea if Israel does not sever Judea and
Samaria from itself - <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/library/article.php?articleid=721">a threat that has been decisively proven
false</a>. Wake
up Israel! There is no more danger of being overwhelmed demographically
today than there was 50 years ago. If you are really worried, then work
on convincing your 6-12 million brethren still living abroad to come
home. That would eliminate any imagined or real demographic threat once
and for all. Thank God the Jews who took part in Israel&#8217;s rebirth did
not listen to such nonsense, or the Jewish state may still be just a
dream.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rather than sit in relative obscurity as the Knesset&#8217;s fifth largest
party, Binyamin Netanyahu&#8217;s Likud is now the third largest party after
Thursday&#8217;s final vote tally resulted in a small but significant shake up
in the allocation of seats in the 17th Knesset. The 17th Knesset will
now look like this following the count of the final 150,000 ballots from
on-duty IDF soldiers, prisoners, Israelis abroad, etc: 1. Kadima - 29
seats (+1) 2. Labor - 20 seats 3. Likud - 12 seats (+1) 4. Shas - 12
seats (-1) 5. Israel Beiteinu - 11 seats (-1) 6. National Union/National
Religious - 9 seats 7. Pensioner&#8217;s Party - 7 seats 8. United Torah
Judaism - 6 seats 9. Meretz - 5 seats (+1) 10. Ra&#8217;am-Ta&#8217;al - 3 seats
(-1) 11. Balad - 3 seats 12. Hadash - 3 seats So all of you who were
praying for &#8220;Bibi&#8221;, keep doing so! This seemingly minor alteration means
that he will most likely now serve as official opposition leader, rather
than the head of a largely insignificant faction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international media this week unsurprisingly and enthusiastically
took Hamas&#8217; desire to hold talks with the Middle East Quartet as proof
of its assertion that the terror group had moderated upon assuming
power. Hamas it seems is doing a good job of following Arafat&#8217;s example
of covering its blood-stained hands in silk gloves in its dealings with
the outside world. Very quickly will the international media start to
totally ignore more hostile statements like
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498753484&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">this</a>:
> &#8220;The Koran is our constitution, Mohammed is our prophet, jihad [holy
war] is our path and dying for the sake of Allah is our biggest wish.&#8221;
And
<a href="http://today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-28T182118Z_01_L26268658_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST-HAMAS-VOTE.xml">this</a>:

region&#8230;we&#8217;re not warmongers and we don&#8217;t call for terrorism and
bloodshed.&#8221; Of course, none of the above statements, even the supposedly
&#8220;moderate&#8221; one, says anything about peaceful coexistence with the Jewish
state. A &#8220;just peace&#8221; for Hamas means the eradication of Israel and its
replacement with an Arab Muslim state.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can someone please convince the Bush Administration that <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/03/28/strategies_for_a_global_counterinsurgency/">these
truths</a>
also hold true in Israel: > In Iraq and around the world, we will never
peacefully dissuade those dedicated to violence against us. They must be
captured or killed. Nor are the actual terrorist murderers the only
problem: > sympathetic local populations&#8230;sustain the insurgency with
cash, weapons, and intelligence. And, in the case of the Palestinian
Arabs&#8217; overwhelming elecion of Hamas, with international legitimacy. The
article also provides logic that perfectly explains how and why Hamas
managed to score its electoral coup: > Hamas is an &#8220;enemy who thrives
by delivering empowerment and vengeance to [a population] drowning in
poverty, social humiliation, and political marginalization. These masses
in return sustain the enemy &#8211; passively with cover and actively with
fighters. Where I disagree with the authors is in their view that
overwhelming firepower is not part of the answer, but rather greater
involvement of local law inforcement. If the Israeli-Arab conflict has
taught anything, it is that in the Muslim world the perception of
strength carries much weight. When the enemy is perceived as strong, the
terrorists are deterred. When the enemy is perceived as weak due to its
failure to respond strongly to the terrorists&#8217; threat, those terrorists
are better able to convince local populations of their own strength, and
so gain greater support. The authors get back on track with their
assessment of the need for a re-education of the local population. The
overall strategy, however, should be closer to that implemented again
Japan in World War II - a strategy that worked perhaps better than any
expected. The Japanese were a people unquestionably dedicated to war on
behalf of their deified emperor. It was overwhelming American firepower
that convinced them of their own weakness and the need to lay down their
arms, leading to the ability to carry out a true re-education of the
general population. Israel&#8217;s approach should be no different - the
outright defeat of its enemies, followed by a concerted
Israeli-controlled campaign to win the hearts and minds of the local
Arabs through education. This, of course, is unlikely to happen in the
current liberal atmosphere of appeasement. Fortunately, all hope is not
lost. One day the overwhelming firepower of the Messiah will defeat
Israel&#8217;s enemies, and a divine program of re-education will transform
not only the Arabs&#8217; hearts and minds, but their very souls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s all over. Israel has voted in a Knesst that _will_ seek to divest
the Jews of their biblical heartland. The breakdown looks like this: 1.
Kadima - 28 seats 2. Labor - 20 seats 3. Shas - 13 seats 4. Israel
Beiteinu - 12 seats 5. Likud - 11 seats 6. National Union/National
Religious Party - 9 seats 7. Pensioner&#8217;s Party - 7 seats 8. United Torah
Judaism - 6 seats 9. Meretz - 4 seats 10. United Arab List - 4 seats 11.
Balad - 3 seats 12. Hadash - 3 seats The election outcome was the
product of most of the nation&#8217;s Jews convincing themselves that the
coming surrender is somehow an act of self-strength. But Kadima leader
Ehud Olmert has conveyed anything but strength as he laid out the
intended policies of Israel&#8217;s next government. > &#8220;We are tired of
fighting, we are tired of being courageous, we are tired of winning, we
are tired of defeating our enemies, we want to be able to live in an
entirely different environment of relations with our enemies,&#8221; said
Olmert in June of last year. Problem is, Israel may be tired of having
to fight for its land, for its rights, for its very life, but the
nation&#8217;s enemies are not. > &#8220;We will never let the Jews rule
Palestinian territories,&#8221; said Hamas official Shaikh Mohammed Mahmud Al
Siyam in Pakistan this week. Al-Siyam was of course referring to _all_
of &#8220;Palestine&#8221; - the entire Jewish state. > &#8220;The Koran is our
constitution, Mohammed is our prophet, jihad [holy war] is our path and
dying for the sake of Allah is our biggest wish,&#8221; shouted Hamas
legislator Hamed Bitawi to thunderous applause as his party&#8217;s government
was sworn in Tuesday. The deception leading Israel down its current path
of weakness, despite the openly stated intentions of its enemies, is the
same deception that caused Jerusalem to get into bed with Yasser Arafat
and his PLO more than a decade ago. That is not to say the LORD is not
still in control. For He is. His Will will ultimately be done. The
question is how many more Jews have to suffer en route to the
fulfillment of that Will because of the path chosen by their leaders?
Israel could have entered the Promised Land almost immediately after
exiting Egypt, but ended up wandering in a desert for 40 years because
