  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading through the news today on the arms embargo Israel and the
international community are trying to implement against Hizb&#8217;allah, it
struck me how naive the world&#8217;s relations with the Arab Middle East
remain to this day. Germany has sent a team of <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/760189.html">border police and
customs experts</a> to
advise the Lebanese on how to most effectively keep their borders shut
to illegal terrorist arms shipments. The very misguided assumption is
that Beirut wants to and will deny terrorists such as Hizb&#8217;allah the
arms they need just as vigorously as Germany, Britain or the US would.
For some reason, the world continues to ignore the fact that a large
portion of the Lebanese vote for Hizb&#8217;allah in national elections, the
group has two ministers in the Cabinet, Lebanon&#8217;s president <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,428391,00.html">publicly
praises</a>
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah as a national hero, and the army openly admits
that it views Hizb&#8217;allah as a <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=/SpecialReports/archive/200608/SPE20060802a.html">strategic military
asset</a>.
Imagine if following the 9/11 attacks on the US the international
community decided to take Taliban-controlled Afghanistan at its word
that no more arms or funds would reach the Al Qaeda killers in its
midst. I doubt that would have been acceptable to most Americans. Now,
Lebanon is a country deeply divided down religious lines, and some sects
and religions truly do want Hizb&#8217;allah gone. Some even <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525865621&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">take Israel&#8217;s
side</a>
and openly support the Jewish state. But those who genuinly oppose
terrorism, even against Israel, are most definitely the exception in the
Middle East, and are not the majority in Lebanon. Though Hizb&#8217;allah is
Shi&#8217;ite and most of the Arab world is dominated by Sunni Islam, the
maxim &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; forms the basis of most
relations in this region, and few could care less about a group&#8217;s
background so long as it is killing Jews and advancing the greater Arab
cause. And so, while the world believes that Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s minority base
of direct support in Lebanon will equal success for the embargo, we can
expect the terror group to begin taking delivery of Syrian and Iranian
arms again in the very near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Been writing about Kofi Annan a *lot* lately, but he just keeps making
such ridiculous, two-faced statements that he is practically picking on
himself. So, everyone remembers that when the UN put an end to the
recent Israel-Hizb&#8217;allah war, part of the deal was that Hizb&#8217;allah would
be disarmed and no longer capable of threatening Israel. That was then
revised, with the UN saying it could not and would not be the one to
disarm Hizb&#8217;allah, that Lebanon was responsible for doing so. Beirut,
naturally, said it was not going to take the guns out of the hands of a
group it views as a strategic military asset. On Wednesday, Annan looked
to <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/story.asp?j=83230596&amp;p=83z3x898&amp;n=83230976">further clarify
things</a>
from his side by stating that any Lebanese armed terrorist organization
could only be disarmed by national consensus. (Wonder if he would take
the same position if a well-armed murderous group like Hizb&#8217;allah was
operating out of, say, England or Germany or Italy, and attacking
neighboring states?) Anyway, where Annan&#8217;s hypocrisy makes itself
evident here is in the fact that he expects Israel to comply with UN
dictates, regardless of national consensus. In Israel, I guarantee a
majority of the population - and a large majority at that - was for
continuing the war a little longer and crushing Hizb&#8217;allah. And I would
wager they are now for maintaining the blockade on Lebanon as long as
necessary to ensure their abducted troops are returned and Hizb&#8217;allah is
unable to replenish its arsenal. But who cares about Israeli national
consensus? Apparently not Annan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having declared during his election campaign that there was no
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; peace partner and that unilateral withdrawal was Israel&#8217;s
only option, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has now seemingly inexplicably
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060905/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians">shifted
course</a>
and is seeking to restart negotiations with the PLO. And this despite
the fact PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501266.html">apparently on the
verge</a>
of forging a unity government with those most dedicated to Israel&#8217;s
demise - the ruling Hamas organization. There are two possible
explanations for this bizarre behavior: 1. Olmert has suffered
considerable political damage following the recent Lebanon war, and
would like to bring calm to Israel&#8217;s external borders before another
round of fighting erupts. In line with this desire, he is bowing to Arab
insistence that Israel will never have peace with its neighbors until it
reaches an accord with the &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; 2. With his coalition on the
verge of collapse, Olmert is relying on the notion that Israelis will be
reluctant to go to early elections in the midst of an active round of
negotiations. Furthermore, he knows that those to the right of his
Kadima Party oppose the surrender of Judea and Samaria, and that those
to the left oppose unilateral actions in place of a negotiated
settlement. Employing the strategy of his predecessors, Ehud Barak and
Ariel Sharon, Olmert believes he can enter into negotiations that will
inevitably lead nowhere by virtue of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; intransigence, thus
satisfying the full spectrum of Israeli politics. Considering that
Olmert believes himself to be Sharon&#8217;s heir in every way, and that he
has demonstrated that his own political survival is of paramount
importance, option two seems most likely. The danger, of course, is that
Israel cannot enter into negotiations with the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; without
the world getting all starry-eyed about the prospect of &#8220;peace,&#8221; and
putting immense pressure on Israel to accept more undesirable terms and
offer additional concessions. There can be no question that with Hamas
in charge, the chances for even a pretend peace with the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221;
at this point are next to nothing. And the prime minister knows this.
But he is apparently willing to further gamble with the lives of his
people for the sake of <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3299762,00.html">&#8220;four more
years.&#8221;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is unacceptable that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan is *now*
willing to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060905/ap_on_re_mi_ea/mideast">use his &#8220;good
offices&#8221;</a>
to help secure the release of two abducted Israeli soldiers, considering
that they are only in captivity because Annan&#8217;s impotent UN forces
failed to do their job by keeping the peace along Israel&#8217;s northern
border. UN forces have been on the ground in southern Lebanon for nearly
30 years. They were supposed to prevent acts of aggression like
Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s July 12 assault and kidnapping, and the resulting
devastation suffered by both Israel and Lebanon. But they have failed to
do their job for a very long time now. So Annan will forgive Israel and
those of us who support her if his offer of assistance (if a negotiating
a prisoner exchange with terrorists can be called &#8220;assistance) is viewed
with contempt. Tellingly, Lebanon last month complained that UN Security
Council Resolution 1701, which ended the fighting and mandated the
removal of Hizb&#8217;allah as a fighting force, was also too little, too
late. And they were absolutely right, though not in the way they meant
it (Beirut had wanted the UN to force Israel to stop defending itself
much earlier). As stated above, the UN was supposed to prevent such
conflicts from ever arising. Come to think of it, can anyone recall even
one conflict that the UN has managed to contain and resolve by deploying
its silly blue-helmeted peacekeepers? Why in the world does any nation,
let alone Israel, allow itself to believe UN intervention is the answer
to its problems, the antedote to conflict?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan, sporting his pacifist/humanist goggles, declared from Tehran
Sunday that the Iranian nuclear crisis could be easily solved in a
diplomatic manner if the West would <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/758059.html">just show a little
patience</a>. The lack of
Western patience, not Iranian defiance, is the problem. Right. How in
the world is sitting around twiddling our thumbs going to suddenly cause
the Iranians to realize they don&#8217;t want nuclear weapons? Doesn&#8217;t it seem
odd to anyone that Iran is not actually making any demands in return for
not enriching uranium? That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t want anything. Anything
but nuclear weapons, that is. All patience is going to do is give them
an opportunity to build an A-bomb, rendering irrelevant any effort to
prevent Ahmadinejad from ushering in the Islamic age of &#8220;justice,&#8221;
diplomatic or otherwise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As anti-terror operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip draw to a close,
Israel is teaching its terrorist antagonists some lessons, but if recent
media reports are to be believed, they are not the lessons most would
have hoped for. According to Israel&#8217;s largest newspaper (and Egyptian
newspapers before that), Jerusalem is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060903/wl_mideast_afp/mideastconflictgazaegyptprisonertalks">prepared to release up to 800
jailed
terrorists</a>
in return for the freedom of IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit. This after weeks
of clandestine negotiations, despite Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s public
declarations that Israel would not negotiate with terrorists or succumb
to blackmail. Similarly, rumors are rife of a possible prisoner exchange
with Hizb&#8217;allah. Interestingly, both of these prisoner swaps, if indeed
they are in the works, would take place after major Israeli military
operations sparked by the abductions. Israel could have agreed to and
conducted an exchange without going to war in Gaza and Lebanon. It would
seem to defeat justification of going to war (to create a future
deterrent) if Israel anyway intends to give the terrorists what they
wanted in the first place. And it certainly signals to both Hamas and
Hizb&#8217;allah that future kidnappings will be worthwhile. Israel is
apparently operating under the misguided assumption that the terrorists
will view future kidnappings as too costly because of the men they lost
during this summer&#8217;s fighting. What Jerusalem for some reason fails to
grasp, even after all this time, is that the numbers of men lost in the
fighting or gained in the subsequent prisoner swaps are unimportant to
the terrorists. What matters is the precedent, the damage to Israel&#8217;s
morale, and the further deterioration of Israel&#8217;s image in the region as
a power not to be tempted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has put his &#8220;convergence&#8221; plan on the
back burner for now, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he has forgotten about it or
doesn&#8217;t plan to still implement it. After all, he and his colleagues
insisted during the election campaign that Israel has no other hope but
to surrender Arab-dominated Judea and Samaria. But even if Olmert and
his buddies were right in asserting that holding the cradle of Jewish
civilization poses a demographic threat to the modern Jewish state (<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/848">and
they are not</a>), the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525989023&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">more
immediate
threat</a>
of having all Israel covered by short-range enemy rocket fire should
raise some giant red flags. Imagine all of northern Israel to the
Jezreel Valley under attack from Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s 10,000 rockets, the
populous central region taking fire from Samaria, Jerusalem being
bombarded by Judea-based rocket cells, and Beersheva, Ashkelon and the
south suffering a barrage of Gaza-launched missiles. After last month&#8217;s
Lebanon war, that scenario must be viewed as realistic. And if it does
happen, it will completely shut this nation down. No business, no
commerce, no air travel, no tourism, etc. The desolation that existed in
northern Israel from July 12 to August 14 of this summer would extend to
every border of the Jewish state. The demographic threat is a theory, an
assumption. The rockets are a very real and proven threat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ultra-leftist Israeli journalist and political figure Yossi Sarid was
invited several months ago by the Norwegian foreign ministry to attend
and address a conference on religious and cultural tolerance in Bali,
Indonesia. However, when the Indonesian co-sponsors and national hosts
discovered that an Israeli was on the guest list, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/755211.html">Sarid was promptly
uninvited</a>. Kind of
defeats the purpose of a conference on tolerance when the invitation
stage is marred by intolerance. (Side note: It is also telling that the
weak Norwegian - ie. European - response was not to demand that
Indonesia soften its stance, but rather to offer Sarid Norwegian
citizenship in order to bypass the boycott. Europe&#8217;s fear of and
capitulation to Islam is by no means confined to the continent.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s failures in its month-long war with Hizb&#8217;allah continue to
mount. As the fighting came to a sudden halt under a UN-imposed
ceasefire, it was clear that Hizb&#8217;allah had not suffered a crushing
blow, was still capable of firing missiles into Israel, and would not
release two abducted IDF soldiers. But, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
declared, at least Israel had created the conditions for forcing the
removal of Hizb&#8217;allah as a fighting force from southern Lebanon and its
eventual disarmament by the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers.
Unsurprisingly, Israel <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525940768&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">has now
admitted</a>
that those achievements were nothing but smoke and mirrors. According to
The Jerusalem Post, Israel&#8217;s current leadership has resigned itself to
the fact that Hizb&#8217;allah can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be disarmed by Beirut or the
UN, and that its deep roots in southern Lebanon make its removal from
the area impossible. Israel&#8217;s new focus: making sure an arms embargo on
Hizb&#8217;allah is fully implemented so that the group cannot replenish its
arsenal of long-range offensive weapons. As it becomes increasingly
clear that Lebanon and the UN are not going to use armed force to
prevent Syrian shipments to Hizb&#8217;allah, it is only a matter of time
before that achievement, too, falls by the wayside.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The governing Conservatives in Canada <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060823/wl_canada_afp/mideastunrestlebanon">displayed outstanding
clarity</a>
this week when an opposition lawmaker cited Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s &#8220;political
wing&#8221; as justification for treating with the group&#8217;s leadership. Said
Liberal MP Borys Wrzesnewskyj: > &#8220;Hizb&#8217;allah has a political wing. They
have members of Parliament. They have two cabinet ministers. You want to
encourage politicians in this military organization so that the centre
of gravity shifts to them.&#8221; The response from Conservative MP Jason
Kennedy was right on: > &#8220;There was another political party in the past
which had democratic support, which provided social services, which
played an important role in the political life of its country in Germany
in the 1930s, which was also dedicated to violence against the Jewish
people. > > &#8220;The world was wrong to negotiate with that party then,
and it would be wrong to negotiate with Hizb&#8217;allah today.&#8221; Fortunately
that understanding is, for now, also keeping the world from insisting
that Israel negotiate with the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Shame
that Bush Sr. and Clinton did not have such clarity when they accepted
Yasser Arafat as a national leader and world diplomat, and strong-armed
Israel into talks with the &#8220;political arm&#8221; of his PLO.</p>
