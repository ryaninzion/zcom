  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most supporters of Israel readily recognize the underlying anti-Israel
bias that taints the reporting of the mainstream international media
(MSM). Forcing the MSM to acknowledge this phenomenon in an effort to
change it, however, is a different story. Journalists from every other
part of the world will vehemently deny practicing any bias or subjective
reporting against Israel. Not so in the Arab world. Journalists employed
by the top Arab media outlets - both television and newspapers - <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/742278.html">openly
admit</a> their disdain
for the Jewish state, and their desire, in every interview conducted and
report submitted, to make Israel look bad. > &#8220;The newscaster has to
always be ready to make the Israeli interviewee uncomfortable, to pin
him down in the narrow alleys of his lies,&#8221; said Mai al-Sharabani of the
Al-Arabiya network. When the fast pace of events in the Middle East do
not afford Arab television newscaster the opportunity to adequatly
prepare the trap for their Israeli interviewees, they simply make use of
&#8220;those precious final seconds of the interview, in which they can make a
venomous remark that will not garner any response by the interviewee,
for the simple reason that it is the end of the conversation,&#8221; notes
_Ha&#8217;aretz&#8217;s_ Zvi Bar&#8217;el. But sometimes even that degree of control is
not enough, and al-Sharabani admits to having to go to great lengths to
restrain herself. > &#8220;There are times when I am forced to suppress a
voice that rises within me, and which wants me to tell the Israeli
interviewee: shut your mouth, you barefaced liar.&#8221; Al-Arabiya journalist
Mohammed Abu Obeid concurs with his colleague regarding the importance
of entering into an interview with Israelis under the presumption they
are wrong: > &#8220;Newscasters understand the magnitude of the
responsibility placed on them in interviewing Israelis. Millions of
Arabs watch them, waiting to see how we will embarrass them or crush
them in an interview.&#8221; While these examples will come as little surprise
to anyone who is aware of the Arab world&#8217;s hatred for Israel, it does
highlight the importance of choosing carefully who we allow to feed us
information about the wider world. The Arabs are open about their
violations of journalistic standards, but much of the MSM is guilty of
the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is much talk lately of what is the &#8220;root cause&#8221; of the current
fighting in Gaza and southern Lebanon, with much of the world pointing
an accusatory finger at Hamas and Hizb&#8217;allah. Former IDF chief Moshe
Ya&#8217;alon took that one step further by <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC06.php?CID=951">pointing
out</a> that
the Hamas and Hizb&#8217;allah aggression and provocations originated from
areas Israel had completely vacated, disproving the long-held belief
that &#8220;Israeli occupation&#8221; is the &#8220;root cause&#8221; of the wider Middle East
conflict. Indeed, Arab aggression against the Jewish state predated
Israeli control of Judea, Samaria, Gaza, southern Lebanon or the Sinai
Peninsula. Ya&#8217;alon suggests the true root cause of today&#8217;s fighting is
Iranian and Syrian support for radical Islamic elements bent on Israel&#8217;s
destruction. He is mostly right. It is true that if Iran and Syria were
not supporting and financing Hamas and Hizb&#8217;allah, the current crises
might not exist. But the totalitarian regimes in Damascus and Tehran and
the &#8220;radical&#8221; Islamists actually carrying out attacks on Israel are
themselves not the root cause of the region&#8217;s troubles. The root cause,
even deeper than the open belligerence of these characters, is the
ongoing failure of probably 90-95 percent of the Middle East&#8217;s residents
to accept the Jewish state at all. The core of the problem is education,
and the Arabs&#8217; refusal to teach the next generations to peacefully
coexist with Israel. Millions of young Arabs are growing up believing
Israel is a cancer that must be eradicated, and as long as this is the
case, it won&#8217;t matter how many rogue regimes and terror groups you take
out, more will always pop up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Beri Monday <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/742222.html">demonstrated
precisely</a> why Israel&#8217;s
offensive against Hizb&#8217;allah must continue unabated for the time being.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Beirut Monday to present
a ceasefire deal that would see an immediate bilateral cessation of
hostilities, followed by the insertion of an international force into
southern Lebanon tasked with removing Hizb&#8217;allah arms from the area.
Israel has already signalled its readiness to accept a new international
force (preferably NATO-led) in Lebanon, and the withdrawal (if not total
disarmament) of Hizb&#8217;allah north of the Litani River. But Beri, a
Hizb&#8217;allah ally, rejected the deal outright, apparently preferring a
continuation of hostilities to seeing his terrorist buddies de-fanged. I
wonder if his Lebanese constituents would back that position? Beri did
not close the door completely. He said the world could have its
ceasefire, but on the aggressor&#8217;s terms: Israel halts its offensive
immediately; Israel agrees to swap thousands of jailed terrorists for
its two abducted soldiers; the world backs off while Lebanon alone
decides whether or not a terrorist organization is allowed to rule its
southern regions. Sounds like Israel needs to eliminate a few more bad
guys before they get the message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Association for Civil Rights (ACR) - your typical liberal
everything-is-Israel&#8217;s-fault human rights organization - <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3280788,00.html">got all worked
up</a> Monday
after IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz said every Hizb&#8217;allah missile
barrage on Haifa would be met with a similar IDF bombing of southern
Beirut. I thought the international community wanted Israel to react in
a &#8220;proportionate&#8221; manner? What could be more proportionate than doing to
your enemy exactly what he has done to you? The ACR claims that Halutz
made his comments in an attempt to motivate Israeli forces on the basis
of revenge. As if Israelis at this point need any further motivation to
fight back against Hassan Nasrallah&#8217;s murderous hordes. His words would
be better characterized as deterrence. The group also made the totally
unsubstantiated claim that Halutz&#8217;s threat meant the &#8220;indiscriminate
targeting of civilians and civilian interests.&#8221; But you see, that is
where Israel&#8217;s response is no longer proportionate to Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
aggression. Unlike Hizb&#8217;allah, Israel takes as much care as possible to
avoid harming the civilian population. That civilians are killed because
Hizb&#8217;allah positions itself among them is not Israel&#8217;s fault, nor does
it preclude Israel from targeting those positions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>United Nations chief Kofi Annan, who consequently has a dismal record of
conflict resolution, announced Thursday <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3279116,00.html">his
plan</a> for
ending the fighting between Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah. An immediate and
simultaneous cessation of hostilities by both sides, the transfer of
Israel&#8217;s abducted soldiers to the Lebanese army, and the creation of yet
another toothless international committee tasked with overseeing the
disarmament of Hizb&#8217;allah - and everything should be right as rain. Just
one problem: those terms are inconsistent with Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s present
objectives and strategic goals. Annan&#8217;s naivety - or perhaps it&#8217;s a
clever personification of gullibility in the employ of more sinister
goals - has been long established. But even he can&#8217;t truly believe, or
expect the Israelis to believe, that Hizb&#8217;allah is going to now just
hand over the two Israelis it is holding and lay down its arms.
Hizb&#8217;allah is in this fight for the long haul - the group has repeatedly
stated and demonstrated that. Like its sponsors in Tehran and Damascus,
Hizb&#8217;allah desires the annihilation of the Jewish state, and is not
going to voluntarily fold for anyone; especially not the impotent UN and
its soft-spoken leader. So, what happens when Hizb&#8217;allah fails to hand
over the soldiers and allow itself to be disarmed? The answer is obvious
for anyone that has been paying attention to this conflict. The UN
committee will become bogged down in endless debate over what to do
about Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s brazen defiance (remember Saddam?), two Israelis will
live out the remainder of their days in traumatic captivity, and the
Jewish state will suffer a crushing blow to its morale, having failed to
defeat its tormenter or secure the freedom of its kidnapped soldiers. A
clear recipe for further bloodshed in the near future. If Annan truly
wants a resolution - and by resolution I mean a LASTING solution - to
this particular facet of the wider conflict, he needs to let Israel
finish off Hizb&#8217;allah.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a very important lesson regarding the &#8220;land-for-peace&#8221; process
that Israel must learn from the current battle with Hizb&#8217;allah.
Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre - at least as far as the world was concerned
- was Israel&#8217;s occupation of southern Lebanon. But six years ago, Israel
withdrew from every square inch of Lebanon, as demanded by the
international community. And yet, Hizb&#8217;allah remains, and is causing
more trouble today than ever before. That is because Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s true
raison d&#8217;etre, according to its own covenant and statements, is the
annihilation of the Jewish state. The same is true not only for more
&#8220;radical&#8221; groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but also for Fatah and
the entire PLO, which were established for the &#8220;liberation of
Palestine.&#8221; It is telling to watch the reaction of the Palestinian Arabs
as Hizb&#8217;allah assaults their Israeli &#8220;peace&#8221; partners. While the entire
Arab world outside of Syria is criticizing Hizb&#8217;allah, the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are cheering on the Lebanese terrorists. They are not, as
one would expect of participants in their own land-for-peace process,
urging Hizb&#8217;allah to halt its aggression now that it has achieved its
initial territorial demands. No, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are actually
hollering for Hizb&#8217;allah to hurry up and start lobbing missiles into Tel
Aviv. The &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are demonstrating that even if they are given
100% of Judea, Samaria and Gaza - including eastern Jerusalem - they are
as likely as not to follow the lead of their Hizb&#8217;allah role models and
find a reason (the very existence of Israel) to fight on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international community bears no small degree of responsibility for
the current fighting between Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah. Israeli academic and
sometimes government advisor Gerald Steinberg <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=30130">wrote this
week</a> about how in early
2000 he had participated in a meeting with European Union officials at
the forefront of international pressure to get Israel out of southern
Lebanon. > &#8220;In detailed talks that took place at the French
ambassador&#8217;s residence in Jaffa&#8230;the Europeans assured us that once
Israel retreated, Hezbollah would lose its raison d&#8217;etre as a &#8216;militia&#8217;
and transform itself into a political party. France and its partners
would send peacekeepers to prevent terror and missile attacks against
Israel, help the Lebanese army take control of the border, and disarm
Hezbollah.&#8221; When the IDF withdrew a few months later, Europe and the
rest of the world heralded Israel&#8217;s capitulation as a real chance for
peace, and did absolutely nothing as Hizb&#8217;allah, drunk with victory,
turned it into anything but. It took only five months for an emboldened
Hizb&#8217;allah to launch its first cross-border raid, which resulted in the
abduction and slaying of three IDF soldiers. Had Europe and the world
fulfilled their promises to Israel back then, the region would not be in
&#8220;crisis&#8221; today. Islam&#8217;s rejection of Israel may be the root cause of the
violence, but the international community - in particular Europe and the
UN - is its primary facilitator. If the world really wants to see peace
and stability in the Middle East, it needs to learn from its mistakes,
shut its mouth, and let Israel take care of business.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If the West is, as it says, engaged in a global war on terror, it must
view the current fighting between Israel and Hizb&#8217;allah as a golden
opportunity to take out one of the world&#8217;s most powerful terrorist
organizations. Hizb&#8217;allah is a group with the blood of many Americans
and other Westerners, in addition to Israelis, on its hands. It has a
sophisticated and substantial fighting force that enjoys the financial
and logistical support of two sovereign nations. And it has cells and
offices in nations across the globe, including the United States,
involved in fundraising and planning assaults against Jewish and
non-Jewish targets abroad. Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s reach was clearly demonstrated
in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. And unlike Osama bin Laden&#8217;s loose and hunted Al Qaeda
network, Hizb&#8217;allah is a unified force that not only enjoys safe harbor
and absolute freedom of movement, but actually controls parts of the
Lebanese government via the democratic process. Hizb&#8217;allah should be
target number one as this war enters its sixth year. And there will be
no better opportunity than the one offered by the present crisis to take
Hizb&#8217;allah out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Displaying a hateful disregard for Israeli life, the United Nations
Tuesday completely ignored the mounting humanitarian crisis in northern
Israel and instead whined about Lebanese civilians displaced by a war
started by their Hizb&#8217;allah brethren. While the UN claims some 500,000
Lebanese have been forced to flee their homes by Israel&#8217;s response to
Hizb&#8217;allah aggression, some two million Israelis have either fled or are
living in bomb shelters as a result of incessant terrorist missile fire.
But acknowledging that fact would rob the UN of engaging in its favorite
pastime - Israel-bashing. And check out <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3277987,00.html">this
statement</a> by
UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland from Beirut: > &#8220;We hear and
see a population which feels trapped as they are subject to
indiscriminate attacks.&#8221; &#8220;Indiscriminate attacks&#8221;??? What about
Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s relentless bombardment of northern Israel population
centers with unguided weaponry? Isn&#8217;t that &#8220;indiscriminate&#8221;? As usual,
the UN is trying to blur the lines and create moral equivalency between
Israel its enemies. The fact is that Israel is very carefully picking
its targets in an effort to minimize the loss of civilian life. Even
when launching a simple retaliatory strike, an IDF artillery officer
explained to Fox News Monday that Israel&#8217;s sophisticated equipment is
able to pinpoint the origin of Hizb&#8217;allah rocket fire and return fire
precisely on that location. If that location happens to be a residential
home, apartment building or school, that is not Israel&#8217;s fault. That
Hizb&#8217;allah has illegally chosen to situate its forces and strategic
positions among the civilian population does not, under international
law, restrict Israel from striking its enemy. The blood of any innocents
killed is on Hizb&#8217;allah alone. This conflict is doing much to show UN
anti-Israel bias for what it really is. Behold the new face of
anti-Semitism.</p>
