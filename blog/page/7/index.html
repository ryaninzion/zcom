  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel is about to release 250 jailed terrorists in an effort to bolster
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. What the government of Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert is really offering so that Abbas can prove he is capable of
extracting concessions is an as-yet-undetermined number of Israeli
lives. Israel&#8217;s Justice Ministry admitted on Wednesday that one-fifth of
the terrorists Israel releases in these kind of deals and gestures
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184766004268&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">immediately resume their efforts to kill Jewish men, women and
children</a>.
According to figures provided by the Almagor Terror Victims Association,
a good number of them have succeeded in doing so the second time around.
At least 179 Israelis have been killed over the past seven years by
Palestinians released from Israeli jails. Imagine if this had happened
to the US. Imagine if Washington agreed to release a group of prisoners
from Guantanamo, and one of them proceeded to strap on a bomb and kill
Americans somewhere in the world. It would only happen once, because the
US would never again even consider such a concession. And yet, Israel is
pressured to repeat this scenario over and over again, with the
government offering the typical justification that none of the 250 to be
freed on Saturday have &#8220;blood on their hands,&#8221; meaning they have not
participated directly in the murder of any Israelis. Of course, most of
these prisoners tried to get blood on their hands, but were caught
before they could do so. And the government is letting them go with the
knowledge that a lot of them will again try to kill. In about six months
we should know how many Israelis died so that Olmert could receive a pat
on the back and a limited round of praise from the international
community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a major four-year-old refugee crisis resulting from the Arab
cleansing of ethnic Africans from Sudan&#8217;s Darfur region, and I am
wondering: Where are the offers of aid from European nations that were
more than ready to give asylum to Palestinian killers? The poor,
oppressed souls pouring out of Darfur are being forced to take up
residence in ill-equipped tent camps, or to seek refuge in Egypt and
Israel. But Egypt is not treating them much better than the Arabs of
Sudan did, and Israel is unable to absorb any great number of these
refugees. So why are the nations of Europe, who pretend to care so much
about Palestinian refugees and other dispossessed peoples around the
world, not opening their gates to the Sudanese? Why are they not
offering to help? Tiny, resource-strapped Israel cannot offer these
people a permanent solution, Egypt is mistreating them, and Arabs from
neighboring Chad are now being invited to take over their former homes.
These people have no where to go, and no one with the means to do so is
helping them. What really infuriates me about this issue is that just
five years ago, Europe provided asylum to 13 nun-abusing Palestinian
terrorists after the Israeli army pinned them down in Bethlehem&#8217;s Church
of the Nativity. Were those killers more worthy of being spared and
aided than the men, women and children that have fled Darfur?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s Labor Party is <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184672473918&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">accusing US President George W.
Bush</a>
of proposing a Middle East peace summit this fall in order to delay
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s inevitable political demise. Party sources
noted that Bush&#8217;s announcement of an international summit in his Middle
East policy speech this week will blunt growing calls for Olmert&#8217;s
removal. No one is willing to be responsible for political instability
in Israel just before a major peace conference. This represents a major
coup for Bush and his &#8220;two-state vision.&#8221; Despite <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=12927">mounting Israeli
opposition</a>
to any further surrender of land, Olmert is the one viable national
leader still dedicated to conducting significant withdrawals, which, of
course, are essential to Bush&#8217;s desire to play midwife to &#8220;Palestine.&#8221;
If elections are held in the coming months and Netanyahu becomes prime
minister, the White House can forget about the uprooting of any more
Jewish settlements any time soon, and certainly not before the end of
Bush&#8217;s tenure as president. Even if Netanyahu loses the election to Ehud
Barak, the Labor Party leader would definitely remember that he was
crushed in the 2001 prime ministerial election precisely because he had
offered so much to Yasser Arafat, an offer that most Israelis see as
having encouraged the Palestinians to launch their &#8220;intifada.&#8221; And so,
Bush needs Olmert to get the Jews out of Judea and Samaria if he is to
have any chance of fulfilling his <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/268">self-appointed
task</a> of bringing peace to the
Holy Land.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Italy&#8217;s foreign minister on Tuesday insisted that <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/882918.html">Hamas represents an
integral part of the Palestinian
Arabs</a>, and must
therefore be engaged rather than shunned. While I don&#8217;t agree that
Hamas&#8217; crimes should be overlooked and the group granted legitimacy, I
do agree that it is a &#8220;significant and substantial&#8221; component of
Palestinian Arab society, a &#8220;ground roots movement,&#8221; to use the words of
Massimo D&#8217;Alema. And that in itself is very telling of Palestinian
society. Hamas does not exist in a bubble, it is not some self-contained
group of radicals completely disconnected from those around it. Hamas&#8217;
members - the thousands and thousands of gunmen and suicide bombers -
are all recruited from among the Palestinian Arab public. There is
obviously a very large pool of potential recruits for the group to fish
in. Then there are the opinion polls that show widespread general public
support for both Hamas as a movement, and its acts of violence against
Israel&#8217;s Jews. And, of course, we have Hamas&#8217; landslide electoral
victory in last year&#8217;s parliamentary election, when a huge majority of
Palestinian voters chose the terror group to lead them. D&#8217;Alema is right
- Hamas is a significant and substantial part of Palestinian Arab
society, a group that enjoys widespread support from a general public
that also provides the group with a steady supply of fighters. The
lesson that D&#8217;Alema and the rest of the international community fail to
take from this is that a society that can give birth to and provide a
firm power base for a group such as Hamas is not a society that is ready
for peace with Israel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A senior Israeli general on Monday confirmed that the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) are <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13461">training for a full-scale war with
Syria</a>,
and that plans have been laid for a swift victory. But in the event of a
conflagration, will Israel&#8217;s leadership allow those plans to be
implemented? According to Maj.-Gen. Eyal Ben-Reuven, who served as
deputy commander of Israel&#8217;s northern forces during last summer&#8217;s war,
the new battle plan calls for a rapid and overwhelming ground invasion
of Syria. The reason the IDF wants as many boots on the ground in Syria
as quickly as possible is because in a war scenario, Syria is expected
to try to demoralize Israel by hitting its population centers with
hundreds of ballistic missiles. Ben-Reuven noted that Syria itself would
be unconcerned by mass military or civilian casualties, but would
certainly try to play on Israel&#8217;s sensitivity to civilian losses. So the
army has what sound like solid plans in place, and the troops are
preparing to implement them should the need arise. The question is, does
the political echelon have the guts to let the IDF do its thing if the
predictions of war by a wide array of military experts prove accurate?
My feeling is that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is too afraid of a repeat
of last summer&#8217;s failures to respond with any great force to low-level
cross-border provocations by Syria. I also see Olmert as being way too
controlling to let the IDF brass run the show their way. However, this
time around Ehud Barak is in the picture, and he needs a big military
victory in order to boost his chances of beating Likud leader Binyamin
Netanyahu in future national elections. Barak can likely be expected to
leverage his Labor Party&#8217;s participation in the government to force
Olmert to give him free reign as defense minister. And, as I noted
above, Barak needs a military victory, and so is probably ready to go to
war. Barak is also a military man - in fact, he is Israel&#8217;s most
decorated soldier ever - and as such will hopefully understand the
wisdom behind the army&#8217;s plans.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have written on the issue of <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/1861.htm">Palestinian children being indoctrinated
to hate and fight Israel</a>
before, but the issue warrants rehashing in light of the new Hamas
children&#8217;s program until recently hosted by a Mickey Mouse look-alike.
To be sure, anti-Israel incitement in the Palestinian media and local
school curriculums is nothing new and is ongoing. Unfortunately, that
gross violation of the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s agreements with Israel is
rarely covered by an international press more interested in blaming
Israel for the Palestinians&#8217; problems. Homas, however, partially
remedied that problem when it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-c6lbFGC4">committed copyright infringement against
Disney</a>, thereby making the
indoctrination of Palestinian children headline news. The latest
development in this saga was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrieBhaGgHM">&#8220;martyrdom&#8221; of Farfur the
Mouse</a> earlier this month at
the hands of a man playing an Israeli security agent. In the clip,
Farfur is seen trying to peacefully argue his right as a Palestinian to
Jerusalem, which he accuses the Jews of conquering and stealing from his
people. Farfur&#8217;s recently announced replacement, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=pFz8DwvJP6Q">Nahool the
Bee</a>, is not prepared to be led
meekly to slaughter like his &#8220;cousin,&#8221; and tells his young audience in
the newest installment of _Tomorrow&#8217;s Pioneers_ that they must &#8220;take
revenge upon the enemies of Allah, the murderers of the prophets [a
common Islamic reference to the Jews]&#8230;until [Jerusalem] will be
liberated from their filth.&#8221; As a father, watching these clips hit me
hard. I often join my three-and-a-half-year-old son as he enjoys his
favorite programs on Israel&#8217;s popular children&#8217;s channel. Completely
innocent shows that make no reference whatsoever to the conflict around
us. It literally brings tears to my eyes when I then think that children
in my son&#8217;s same demographic in nearby Ramallah, Bethlehem, Hebron and
elsewhere are being taught by their favorite fuzzy characters to hate
and kill. It would devastate me if my son&#8217;s young mind was absorbing
such lessons. This is an issue that needs to really be brought front and
center. Israel, the US, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and everyone
else can negotiate and sign whatever pieces of paper they want, but as
long as Palestinian children are being taught to hate and kill, there
will be no peace. In fact, it is quite telling that official Palestinian
media and the Palestinian Authority school curriculums are teaching
children these things. It means they don&#8217;t see an end to the conflict in
whatever &#8220;final status&#8221; agreement they expect to soon conclude with
Israel. They want their future generations to be ready, mentally and
physically, to fight the Jews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international human rights organizations make a huge stink every
time Israel commits alleged violations against the Palestinians, but are
conspicuously mum when the Palestinians oppress, persecute, torture and
murder one another. Ynet reported on Monday that a man arrested a week
earlier by the Hamas overlords of Gaza was <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3426078,00.html">delivered
dead</a> to a
local hospital with signs of torture and suffocation. A few days ago, I
covered a story for Israel Today about a Palestinian suspected of aiding
Israel&#8217;s war on terror having been <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13411">tortured to death by
Hamas</a>.
These incidents are <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20070710-1154-palestinians-hamasjustice.html">far from
isolated</a>,
and certainly don&#8217;t represent anything new in Palestinian society. My
question is, where are the human rights organizations? Sure, they make a
few muted comments condemning the violence, but where are the white
papers, the investigations, the special committees and emergency UN
sessions these guys always employ when Israel is the target of their
indignation? Once again, friends, the culprit here is anti-Semitism.
Palestinian human rights are only worth defending when when doing so
will help to further discredit Israel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I wrote on Prime Minister Olmert&#8217;s foolish and naive decision
to <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/15/olmerts-foolish-gestures">offer amnesty to the worst Fatah
terrorists</a>
in a ridiculous attempt to &#8220;bolster&#8221; the group&#8217;s leader, Mahmoud Abbas.
Rather than foolish and naive, however, I think this decision can be
better described as short-sighted and self-serving. It simply cannot be
that Olmert and the rest of the Israeli and American leaderships are not
aware that the terrorists who laid down their arms as part of the
amnesty deal will pick them right back up when it serves their interests
to do so. They must know that the terrorists were more enticed by the
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3425455,00.html">$15,000 Abbas offered for every M-16 assault
rifle</a> than
by the prospect of peace and reconciliation with the Jewish state. Did
it somehow escape Olmert that these killers may have laid down one gun,
but in doing so received enough cash to purchase a small arsenal of
weapons? The real reason for these ludicrous decisions, as I see it, is
that in Israel, like in America, the leadership is most concerned about
political approval, about securing a positive &#8220;legacy.&#8221; A momentary pat
on the back, a &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; from the White House seems to be more
important to Olmert than ensuring the future security of his people. How
else can one explain these moves by the Israeli government?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert continues to best himself in making what are
the most reckless, naive &#8220;goodwill gestures&#8221; to the Palestinians that I
have ever seen. Today, Olmert confirmed that he will <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3425342,00.html">offer amnesty to
wanted Palestinian
terrorists</a>
belonging to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; Fatah
movement. These people were at the top of Israel&#8217;s most wanted lists for
a reason, but in the name of &#8220;peace&#8221; their brutal crimes against Jewish
men, women and children are to be forgotten. Olmert justifies this move
by noting the deal states that amnesty will be granted only to those
terrorists who agree to disarm. Two problems: 1. Most of the Fatah
terrorists are also members of the Palestinian Authority police forces,
meaning they are legitimately armed as per Israel&#8217;s agreements with the
Palestinians; 2. Who is going to enforce this disarming? Obviously not
the Israeli army, since it will have promised to stop chasing these
guys. Does Olmert believe that his good buddy Abbas will do the deed for
him? Has Abbas or the Fatah ever given anyone any reason to believe they
will honor any agreement? Olmert just seems to be on this political
free-for-all as he scramble to salvage some kind of positive legacy for
himself. Even though Ariel Sharon made many moves I disagreed with, at
least he was more calculated and had some red lines (even if they did
start to get a bit blurry towards the end). As one who believes in God&#8217;s
Word and His plan for this nation, I am not worried about the ultimate
outcome of everything. However, the number of people who die and the
degree to which Israelis suffer along the way will be determined by the
decisions of their leaders. May God quickly raise up new leaders for
Israel who do not sacrifice the safety and well-being of their people in
self-serving endeavors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>France has reportedly <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3425291,00.html">warned Israel to keep its hands of senior
Hizballah
officials</a>
invited to participate in a diplomatic conference in Paris. The warning
came after French intelligence claimed it learned of a Mossad plot to
nab as many of the Hizballah chiefs as possible. This is precisely the
kind of thing that signals to Islamic terror groups that their use of
brutal violence will ultimately carry no political consequences, and
will likely further their own agenda. Just one year ago, Hizballah
launched an unprovoked war of aggression from within Lebanese territory
on a neighboring state. And that was after the UN had already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council_Resolution_1559">outlawed
Hizballah and demanded its removal as a fighting
force</a>.
Now, like the PLO before it, Hizballah is being granted diplomatic
protection by Western powers. You cannot outlaw a group and denounce its
ways, then watch it attack a neighboring state, and then begin
negotiating with it, all the while expecting that group to eventually
moderate its views. The debacle of opening talks with Yasser Arafat and
his PLO should be evidence of that, to say nothing of the appeasement
