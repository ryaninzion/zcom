  <div class="entry-content"><p>This time they were in fact <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262556,00.html">killed by Israeli
munitions</a>.
But their blood is still on the hands of the terrorists who attempted to
use the civilians as cover.With more than 100 rockets and mortars fired
at Israeli communities since the weekend, the IDF is keen to prevent any
further launches before a catastrophe ensues. A car carrying three
Islamic Jihad terrorists AND the Katyusha rockets they were about to
fire would, therefore, make an obvious target - one that rational people
would do everything to steer clear of. And yet, after the first Israeli
missile obviously failed to kill the Jihad rocket crew, &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
civilian bystanders rushed to the damaged vehicle in an effort to save
their venerated terrorist brethren. Is it just me, or is the natural
reaction not to move away from bad guys being targeted with superior
firepower? I&#8217;m sorry for the tragic losses down there in Gaza, but when
you so foolishly crowd around a flaming hunk of metal that contains
still-living wanted terrorists, you take your life into your own hands.
In this instance, not only the terrorists who were illegally operating
out of civilian areas, but also the civilians who acted so irresponsibly
are accountable for the harm that came to them. No doubt the world, and
in particular the media, will ignore these aspects of today&#8217;s events,
and focus only on the fact that an Israeli missile killed 11
&#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas has already <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262541,00.html">given them their
headline</a>: >
Israel is trying to &#8220;wipe out the Palestinian people.&#8221; Of course, if
that were true, there would be no more &#8220;Palestinian people.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s investigation (without PA cooperation) into last Friday&#8217;s Gaza
beach explosion that killed at least 7 Arab civilians <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262611,00.html">shows the IDF was
in no way
involved</a>.The
most likely culprit is a land mine planted by &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists
to thwart landings by Israeli naval commandos. Needless to say, the
evidence Israel is presenting is not being reported by the international
media with the same enthusiasm and gusto as were the original
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; claims of an Israeli-perpetrated massacre. At any rate,
the simple fact remains that even if the IDF were responsible for the
deadly explosion, the blood of the deceased is ultimately on the hands
of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists, who leave Israel with little choice but to
respond militarily to their incessant rocket fire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Leftist _Ha&#8217;aretz_ columnist Ari Shavit has written another <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/725830.html">sharp
piece</a> urging Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert to halt the headlong rush to national disaster that
his &#8220;convergence&#8221; policies represent. Referencing outgoing National
Security Council head Giora Eiland, Shavit reminds Olmert that, like
him, every Israeli prime minister for the past four decades has
initiated and/or entered into &#8220;peace&#8221; processes believing he could
ultimately control the flow of events and especially Israel&#8217;s degree of
compromise. Every prime minister has been wrong. > &#8220;Eiland makes note
of a fascinating fact: that every prime minister in the past generation
who initiated a foreign policy move was swept into a process with
unexpected results. Menachem Begin never imagined that he would cede all
of Sinai and &#8220;establish&#8221; the Palestinian homeland; Yitzhak Rabin never
imagined that he would effectively create a &#8216;Yasser Arafat state&#8217;; and
Ehud Barak never imagined that he would agree to give back 95 percent of
the West Bank, as well as the Temple Mount.&#8221; > > &#8230; > > &#8220;In
Eiland&#8217;s view, therefore, the pattern that is emerging is fascinating:
One after another, Israeli prime ministers release the genie from the
bottle in the belief that they can tame it, but quickly discover that it
is the genie that is taming them. What was thought to be reversible
turns out to be irreversible. What was planned as a limited operation
becomes comprehensive. The moment the ship leaves the harbor without a
compass, without a clear destination and without a proper map of the
ocean, the strong currents in the international realm exercise their own
will upon it. They mock each Israeli leader in his turn, and sweep his
ship into remote and hazardous quarters.&#8221; We see it happening already
with Olmert and his &#8220;convergence&#8221; plan. What started out as a unilateral
Israeli move aimed at increasing security by pinning down the
terror-backing &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; became, under subtle American pressure, a
means of jump starting the Road Map peace plan. And now Olmert, while
under the gaze of Britain&#8217;s Tony Blair Monday, <a href="http://www.zionist.com/articles/2006/06/12/convergence-looking-more-like-surrender">has
hinted</a>
that the primary aim of his planned withdrawal is to free up enough
contiguous land for the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to set up a sovereign state -
despite the fact that state will be ruled by a terrorist organization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The hypocritical fashion in which the world, and in particular the
international media, relate to the Israeli-Arab conflict was again
demonstrated most vividly over the past several days. On Friday an
explosion killed at least seven Palestinian Arab civilians on a Gaza
Strip beach. A tragic event for which it is still uncertain who is
responsible, despite the wild, unsubstantiated claims by the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; and their leaders of an Israeli-perpetrated massacre.
Though the bloody beach scene could just have easily been caused by an
errant terrorist-fired Katyusha rocket, it was nevertheless exploited as
justification for a barrage of artillery fire on Israeli civilian
centers between Saturday and Monday night. While the international media
broadly and without hesitation condemned Israel over the former, it has
failed to turn the same accusator finger at the Palestinian Authority
over the latter. It does not matter that no Israelis died as a result of
rocket and mortar fire. The intent was to murder as many Jews as
possible. By contrast, if the IDF was in fact responsible for the Gaza
beach explosion, Israel&#8217;s intent was most certainly _not_ the killing
of unarmed Arab men, women and children. That the world media fails to
take all of this into account betrays its venomous bias against the
Jewish state.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s &#8220;convergence&#8221; plan - or whatever he is
calling it this week - was originally billed as a unilateral step taken
from a position of strength and in consideration, first and foremost, of
Israel&#8217;s best interests. But every time Olmert opens his mouth on the
subject his plan is further unmasked as an act of surrender aimed at
appeasing Israel&#8217;s Arab and Western antagonists. The latest example of
this came during a meeting with Britain&#8217;s Tony Blair Monday, during
which Olmert <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262039,00.html">let
slip</a> that
the top motivation behind his plan is to facilitate the formation of a
Palestinian Arab state &#8230; despite the open hostility of the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; towards Israel. > Israel is &#8220;prepared to pull out from
most of the occupied territories [sic] for the formation of a
Palestinian state.&#8221; > > &#8220;We will have to move forward &#8230; To separate
from the Palestinians, pull out from areas of the West Bank amd realign
Israelis in other parts of Israel in order to leave a very large
contiguous territory for a state to be formed by the Palestinians.&#8221;
Olmert went on to explain that by letting Israel retreat from Judea and
Samaria in the face of unrelenting terrorism and hide behind a wall, the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are &#8220;missing a great opportunity.&#8221; I am pretty sure the
Arabs will see the situation in the opposite light, just as they did the
Gaza pullout - a &#8220;victory&#8221; Hamas rode all the way to the prime
minister&#8217;s office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is amazing to me how just a few short years after 9/11 so many
Americans can have already &#8220;moved on&#8221; from that event and abandoned
their nation&#8217;s efforts to defeat the enemy that perpetrated that evil.
This disturbing account comes courtesy of <a href="http://www.changingworldviews.com/">Sharon
Hughes</a>: > **Journalists Applaud
Al-Zarqawi’s Death** > by Sharon Hughes > > Having vowed loyalty to
Osama bin Laden in 2004 and orchestrating what the Washington Post calls
the bloodiest suicide bombings of the insurgency, beheading hostages and
slaughtering thousands if Iraqis in order to incite a civil war with the
goal of driving America’s presence out of Iraq, al-Zarqawi was killed in
a U.S. air strike along with his spiritual advisor, Sheik Abdul Rahman,
on Wednesday. > > Iraqis provided the intelligence and U.S. forces
conducted 17 raids culminating in a target hit on the most-wanted
militant terrorist leader, who had the same U.S. bounty on his head as
Osama bin Laden - $25 million. > > His identity was confirmed by
fingerprints, and when Iraq’s Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced
al-Zarqawi’s death loud applause broke from Iraqi journalists. > >
What? Journalist applauding the news? Think about it. Iraqi journalists
broke out in loud applause at the news of al-Zarqawi’s death! Did
American journalists do the same when President Bush announced the news?
Or in another venue? Nope. > > The Left’s talk show hosts were off the
chart on the news. As pointed out by Tim Graham at Newsbusters: > > “I
caught some of the opening minutes of the Stephanie Miller show today
(on Air America). They were playing clips of the Rose Garden Bush
remarks and just mocking his accent. &#8220;He&#8217;s extra-twangy today,&#8221; mocked
Miller. The show&#8217;s impressionist started doing Bush in a William
Buckley-esque Connecticut accent, implying the Texas talk is all phony.
Then they began joking &#8220;we&#8217;re auditioning for a new boogey-man,&#8221; as if
Zarqawi was a phantom in a closet.” > > And on his way home from work
he caught Randi Rhodes on the same channel, who clearly is in the
running for the most biased, blind, complete spin-off-the-planet
comments! > > “Hoo boy. She was saying Zarqawi was our boy, someone we
protected in the no-fly zone from Saddam Hussein, and then used as an
excuse for war. A few minutes later, she complained it was a &#8220;sick,
psychotic&#8221; day for news, and said the rulers of America were
&#8220;imperialistic, hegemonistic&#8230;.dictators.&#8221; > > Unbelievable! The days
that follow I’m sure will find more liberal ‘reasoning’ to why catching
this mass murderer of the Iraqi people and our troops is no big deal.
Just watch. How is it that hatred for your own democratically-elected
leader can supercede the need to unite and defeat a common foe? It is
this shocking flaw in the modern liberal mindset that Islam is so
gleefully exploiting as Mohammed&#8217;s hordes advance the cause of Muslim
world domination - you know, that whole _Dar al-Harb_ / _Dar
al-Islam_ thing. America and the Judea-Christian West (because like it
or not, this is a clash of civilizations, a religious war - it always
has been) have every means of winning this fight. They can only be
defeated by their own lack of will and commitment - qualities their
Islamic enemies have in spades.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many have expressed surprise over the fact that while Israel is
preparing to surrender nearly all the lands demanded by the Arabs,
Washington - the primary driver of the land-for-peace process -
maintains a cool and distant approach to the Israeli initiative.
Speaking to Arutz 7, I believe Yoram Ettinger, a former official at the
Israeli Embassy in Washington, hits the nail on the head: > &#8220;The State
Department has always been in favor of Israel&#8217;s return all the way to
the 1949 borders&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;there are those in the State Department who
feel that [Olmert&#8217;s convergence] would be sufficient and would likely
lead to a return to the &#8216;49 borders - but others see how Israel is
planning to annex settlement blocs, and cannot agree.&#8221; The United States
government, and in particular the State Department, are less than
enthusiastic about the planned withdrawal because, at least initially,
Israel, and not the Arabs, will decided how much land is relinquished.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ehud Olmert&#8217;s intention to unilaterally surrender about 90 percent of
Judea and Samaria to the Arabs appears to have international power
brokers concerned that the era of Israeli-Palestinian bilateral
negotiations, and perhaps even official relations, is at an end. From
Washington to Brussels to Moscow, Israel is being pressured to look no
further than PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) in its dying search for
a true and viable peace partner, and thus avert unilateral action that
would put an end to the &#8220;land-for-peace&#8221; process. The international
community is backed in this regard by those Israeli leftists most
responsible for the now-defunct &#8220;Oslo Accords,&#8221; people like Uri Savir,
who wrote in Friday&#8217;s _Jerusalem Post_: > &#8220;Our real partner is&#8230;the
Palestinian people [sic] as embodied by their elected president.&#8221; Now, I
certainly do _not_ support Olmert&#8217;s planned surrender, but the
international community and its leftist Israeli allies are, whether
innocently or by design, guilty of some pretty serious oversights in
pressing for talks with Abu Mazen as an alternative. You see, Abu Mazen
cannot simply sign an agreement between his office and the State of
Israel. Any agreement will have to gain the approval of the elected
representatives of the Palestinians Arabs - the Hamas terrorists who now
control the entire government outside of the president&#8217;s office. What
good would a piece of paper with Abu Mazen&#8217;s signature be if the
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; ministries of the interior, security, media, etc were not
implementing its terms? I&#8217;ll tell you how good it would be - about as
good as the before-mentioned Oslo Accords, the terms of which were also
never implemented by the &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; Though that never stopped the
world from patting itself on the back over those worthless scraps of
paper. But lets say for the sake of argument that Savir and the West are
betting on the right horse, that Abu Mazen is capable of making a deal
with Israel that will actually be implemented. Will it ever be possible
to reconcile the positions of the two sides? And if so, will the outcome
be one that does not endanger Israel&#8217;s future? Savir clearly thinks so:
> &#8220;&#8230;a peace mandate was [Abu Mazen&#8217;s] trump card in the Palestinian
presidential elections; he garnered massive support from his fellow
Palestinians to negotiate peace with Israel.&#8221; But like his colleagues,
this ultra-leftist is only telling part of the story here. Abu Mazen&#8217;s
&#8220;trump card&#8221; during last year&#8217;s election was &#8220;peace&#8221; based on unbending
demands that Israel divide its holy city and allow the Jewish state to
be flooded with millions of so-called Arab &#8220;refugees.&#8221; Abu Mazen&#8217;s
election platform had two facets - words of &#8220;peace&#8221; to keep the West
spellbound, and devotion to the core principles of the PLO&#8217;s &#8220;Phased
Plan&#8221; for the destruction of Israel. There was no facet that should
leave any Israeli believing this man&#8217;s _ultimate_ goal is not the same
as that of his former mentor and colleague, Yasser Arafat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international community&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/714548.html">reaction</a> to
Israel&#8217;s intention to hand most of Judea and Samaria back to the Arabs
without asking anything in return seems to suggest the world doesn&#8217;t
actually want the &#8220;Israeli occupation&#8221; to come to an end. For decades
the international community clammored for Israel to relinquish its
biblical heartland. Eventually, under tremendous pressure, Israel
acquiesced and entered into land-for-peace negotiations with the
so-called &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; After more than a decade of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
intransingence, culminating in the overwhelming electoral victory of
Hamas, a group openly and unswervingly dedicated to Israel&#8217;s
destruction, Jerusalem has decided there simply is no viable partner
with whom to conclude an agreement. But did Israel respond - as it
should have - by saying, &#8220;Look, we told you so, the Arabs don&#8217;t want
peace. Now let us be to administer these liberated lands as only we
can&#8221;? No, Israel&#8217;s response is to throw up its hands and just give to
the Arabs almost all of what they are demanding. And now the world wants
Israel to hold its horses and _not_ surrender the bulk of the land to
the Arabs? Do they want Israel out or not? I guess the problem for the
world is that by unilaterally surrendering, Israel will be more free to
set the terms of its own surrender. If it were done at the negotiating
table, the world could pressure Israel to meet 100% of Arab demands,
rather than just 90%. One hundred years ago, the Jews were certain that
if they could only reestablish their own state they could finally be
masters of their own destiny, able to make decisions they felt were best
for their own people regardless of the whims of the nations. The
international community today is determined to make sure this is not the
case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Palestinian Authority health care system is collapsing, and the
culprit is not a decade of rampant PA corruption, terrorist policies or
an ingrained refusal to compromise and make peace. No, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3248935,00.html">the villain in
this story is none other than
Israel</a>,
according to the less-than-objective Physicians for Human Rights
organization. Devoid of context, the PHR reported that Israel, which
used to routinely look to the medical needs of the Palestinian Arabs, is
causing the current collapse with its checkpoints, curfews and efforts
to deny financial aid to the PA. Rather than remembering that Israel
used to facilitate top-quality medical care in - according to one Arab -
a courteous and very respecful manner and looking to what caused that to
change, the PHR is focusing solely on the effect. But Israel did not
stop helping the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; just for kicks. Israel tightened the
closures and curfews because so many &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; continue to engage
in terrorism against the Jews, regularly exploiting Israeli goodwill to
carry out their murderous acts. And Israel is blocking funding to the PA
because far too many times in the past 10 years that money has directly
financed anti-Jewish terrorism. Furthermore, it should come as no
surprise that Israel&#8217;s feelings towards the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have soured
somewhat after the latter overwhelmingly chose as their leaders an
organization devoted to the annihilation of the Jewish state. This is a
black-and-white case of biting the hand that feeds you. And the PHR
would do well to focus on the one doing the biting.</p>
