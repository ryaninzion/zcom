  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know that the peace between Israel and Egypt is cold at best. But
even the peace between Israel and Jordan, which is often held up as a
model for Israeli-Arab coexistence, is a worthless scrap of paper whose
success is entirely dependent the temperament of the king in Amman. The
fact that the Jordanian people as a whole still don&#8217;t like Israel was
demonstrated at a press conference following a music festival in the
northern Jordan town of Jerash this past weekend. Naturally, since
Israel and Jordan are at peace, a reporter for Israel&#8217;s largest daily
newspaper, _Yediot Ahronot_, felt it was perfectly acceptable for her
to cross the border and cover the event. She was wrong. According to
<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/131834">reports published
Sunday</a>, as
soon as the Israeli identified herself in the course of asking a
question, the Arab journalists around her rose and began advancing in a
menacing manner. The Israeli quickly fled the room fearing for her life.
This happened in Jordan, the one Arab nation that most everyone assumes
has a warm peace with Israel. But that is just a guise to bolster the
idea that peace can be achieved between Israel and the Arab world short
of the Jewish state ceasing to exist. The fact is that the Jordanian
populace as a whole remains bitterly hostile toward Israel. No Jordanian
tour groups ever visit Israel. Jordanians don&#8217;t cross the border to
attend music festivals in Israel. The efforts to normalize ties and live
in peaceful coexistence are all coming from one side. The only reason
the peace has held and been a relative success is because of King
Abdullah, who has more or less followed in the footsteps of his father
and fulfilled at least the security-related aspects of the agreement.
The long-term success of the peace agreement, however, is entirely
dependent on the Hashemite monarchy remaining in power. If Abdullah or
one of his predecessors are ever overthrown and the Palestinian majority
in Jordan takes over, the country will revert to overt hostility toward
Israel. There is peace, but it is between Israel and the Hashemite
monarchy, not between Israel and the nation of Jordan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend we watched The Last King of Scotland, and as the movie
ended it reminded me that Israel used to defend its people with a level
of courage, daring and zeal that I can only call “biblical.” The movie
itself was about Idi Amin&#8217;s reign of terror in Uganda in the 1970s. But
the final scene of the flick was the 1976 hostage crisis at Entebbe
International Airport, when Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air
France plane full of Israelis and Jews and landed it in the Ugandan city
certain that Amin would shelter them while they negotiated their
demands. The movie ends before showing any of the raid, but captions
following the closing of the final scene note that just hours later
Israeli forces stormed Entebbe Airport and freed all but three of the
hostages, killing all of the kidnappers, 45 Ugandan soldiers and
destroying 11 Ugandan fighter jets in the process. All this was done by
a team of only 29 Israelis, who were hundreds of miles from their
borders with no possibility of reinforcement or backup. As I noted
above, the level of courage, daring and zeal shown not only by this team
of commandos, but by the Israeli leadership in executing such a mission
is reminiscent of Israel&#8217;s biblical military heroes. For whatever
reason, that same fire seems to have been snuffed out in Israel over the
past decade or so, at least among the military and political
leaderships. Let&#8217;s all pray that God will restore that fire, that
warrior spirit of David so that fewer Israelis will become victims of
weak political decisions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is the growing apathy apparent in both the US and Israel in the face of
mounting threats further evidence that we are very close to the end of
the present age described in the Bible? A commenter over at <a href="http://www.stangoodenough.com/?p=75">Stan&#8217;s
blog</a> noted that Jesus foretold
that people would grow increasingly apathetic, even about their own
security, just before His return. Matthew 24:37-39: > But as the days
of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in
the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not
know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the
coming of the Son of Man be. It is not that people today should stop
living and hide in their basements, but there is a shocking lack of
concern in Israel regarding the very real possibility of war with Syria,
a war that by all accounts would include the use of long-range ballistic
missile tipped with non-conventional warheads. Most in Israel even seem
to be completely unmoved by the fact that if a war happens, a majority
of the population will be without updated gas masks and emergency
medical kits. Even if there is only, say, a 5% chance of war, wouldn&#8217;t
you still want to be prepared by at least being in possession of an
updated gas mask? And yet, there is no outcry in Israel to get this
done. Indications from friends and acquaintances in the US is that the
situation there is similar. The threat from global jihadists,
nuclear-armed Islamic regimes and an increasingly hostile internal
Muslim population is talked about, but most brush it off as something
that will never affect them. I can only speak first-hand about what is
going on in Israel, but to me the situation just seems to make no sense.
The almost complete lack of concern is nonsensical, especially for a
nation that has faced more than one war of annihilation. That is, unless
you view the situation in the context of Jesus&#8217; words.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Israeli and international medias are abuzz with reports out of
Hebron regarding yesterday&#8217;s forced removal of two Jewish families from
an old wholesale market building they took over outside of the tiny
defined Jewish area of the biblical town. Nearly every report I have
read makes it sound as though these families invaded an active market
and evicted the poor Arabs who were trying to do business there. The
truth, however, is that this particular market has been abandoned for
over 13 years. The Jewish families in question moved into an empty
building adjacent to the present-day Avraham Aveinu neighborhood. Nor is
it the first time the Hebron Jewish community has attempted to occupy
the market. Several Jewish families moved into the building in 2004,
only to be forcibly removed by the government of Ariel Sharon. Why do
these Jews keep trying to take up residence in what is dilapidated and
probably very unsanitary old building? <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/4260.htm">Because it belongs to
them</a>. And that is the
other part of the story that the mainstream media is ignoring. The land
under that market was part of the original Avraham Aveinu neighborhood,
an area of Hebron that had been home to Jews from ancient times right up
until 1929, when Hebron&#8217;s Arabs massacred many of the neighborhood&#8217;s
residents in the most brutal manner. Most are aware that the British
rulers of the area then evacuated the rest of Hebron&#8217;s Jews “for their
own safety,” but failed to prevent the town&#8217;s Arabs from taking over
their property. These properties were originally Jewish owned, and were
stolen by the Arabs after they had violently removed the Jews from their
midst. But leave it those arrogant Arab criminals to not bother to alter
the property registrations, secure in the knowledge that the
international community would always take their side against the Jews
(remember, this was right before the start of the Nazi Holocaust, when
global hatred of the Jews was at a peak). Amazingly, the property in
this part of Hebron was still registered to its original Jewish owners
when Jordan illegally occupied the area in 1948. And Jordan didn&#8217;t
bother to change the records, either! The Jordanians simply listed the
property under the Custodian for Enemy Property, a label Israel
shockingly continues to apply to the real estate in question. Leave it
to the media to omit the most important portions of historical context
surrounding such a story. For more information on the 1929 massacre of
Hebron&#8217;s ancient Jewish community, visit the <a href="http://www.hebron.com/english/articles.php?cat_id=102">website of the
reconstituted Hebron Jewish
Community</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a believer in the Bible, it is difficult to watch Israel&#8217;s leaders
declare that their nation&#8217;s security and future depend solely on its own
military strength and the aid of foreign powers. Trust in God as the
protector and upholder of Israel has likely never formed the basis of
any Israeli leader&#8217;s policy platform, though there are indications that
at least some of the country&#8217;s prime ministers did believe in and
acknowledge the Almighty&#8217;s hand in defending and restoring the Jewish
state. But the heads of the parties currently leading this nation - Ehud
Olmert, Tzipi Livni, Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman, and their mentor,
Shimon Peres - have completely abandoned God&#8217;s Word as the basis for
anything, especially their diplomatic and security policies. Consider
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3430002,00.html">this recent
statement</a> by
Defense Minister Barak: > The IDF’s strength is the guarantee of our
rule and fate, it is what will decide in a war if one is forced on us,
and it is what will bring peace. And <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3431028,00.html">this
one</a> by Prime
Minister Olmert about a week later: > We have renewed agreements and a
renewed commitment from the Americans that would help preserve our
advantage over the Arab countries Israel is warned in the Bible to avoid
trusting its fate to its own military strength and alliances with
foreign powers, and was punished in the past for failing to heed those
warnings. Now, I fully believe that God promises in His Word to never
uproot Israel again. But He also promises to punish Israel in measure
for such violations, and we have been experiencing that limited
punishment for several years now. However, it is going to get worse if
Israel continues to allow itself to be led by people who so defiantly
ignore the God of Israel in their decision-making processes. Israel
needs a leader who puts his or her trust in the Almighty when deciding
how best to defend the nation, even if he/she does so in private.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week&#8217;s forced removal of Jewish residents from homes their families
once owned in Hebron&#8217;s market district reminds me of a recent suggestion
that the Jews of Judea and Samaria consider seceding from Israel rather
than allow the area to become a Palestinian state. As the army moved in
Monday to evacuate the Jewish families from Hebron&#8217;s market area, a
group of religious soldiers that were to take part in the operation
announced that they would not participate in the uprooting of fellow
Jews from any part of the Land of Israel. In addition to following their
conscience, this group of soldiers were also acting on the
recommendations of their rabbis, raising the fear that a large portion
of Israeli soldiers could disobey future military orders and instead act
upon the dictates of their religious leaders. Defense Minister Ehud
Barak <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1186066401087&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">addressed this
fear</a>
following the Hebron incident and the incarceration of the defiant
soldiers: > Our army is the only army we have and the soldiers receive
their orders from their commanders and no one else, no matter how
important or honorable he might be. It is indeed a tricky situation. On
the one hand, allowing this kind of insubordination to take place could
result in other groups of soldiers refusing to execute orders for
different reasons - such as left-leaning combatants refusing to enter
Palestinian-controlled towns to fight terror. On the other hand, this
particular group of soldiers was reacting to a gross violation by the
Israeli government of everything Judaism and the Bible has taught them
regarding their people&#8217;s God-given right to the land. I am not making
any predictions, but I can see this type of thing forming the basis for
a future split between pre-1967 Israel and the Jewish communities of
Judea and Samaria, with the latter taking with it those soldiers who
would adhere to their rabbis instructions not to take part in government
plans to uproot additional settlements as part of a peace deal with the
Palestinians. In fact, someone suggested about a year ago that the
settlers <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48206">consider making just such a
move</a>
in order to stop the internationally-backed land-for-peace process. The
refusal of those 30 soldiers this week to uproot fellow Jews from Hebron
indicated that there just might be enough Israelis willing to go along
with secession to make it a reality if the Olmert government suddenly
tries to surrender the bulk of Judea and Samaria to Israel&#8217;s enemies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Think the Palestinian Authority and neighboring Arab dictatorships are
the only places a group like Hamas can gain official representation and
influence over the government? Think again, because apparently Hamas has
already got its claws in the US administration and America&#8217;s top law
enforcement agency. I typically focus on goings on here in Israel, so
forgive my ignorance up until now of certain aspects of this post that
may have long been common knowledge to many readers. In the wake of 9/11
and amidst the global war on Islamic terror, most are familiar with the
Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a major US-based Muslim
organization that claims to foster understanding of Islam,
reconciliation, etc. But it turns out CAIR is a representative of the
same violent Islamic ideology espoused by Hamas. Again, many will
already be familiar with that fact, given that a number of CAIR staffers
have been indicted on terrorism-related charges and the organization
itself was <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57003">recently named as an unindicted
co-conspirator</a>
in the trial of the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation over its financial
support of Hamas. It turns out CAIR may be even more than a mere admirer
of Hamas - it may be an outright front for the Palestinian terror group.
I was surprised to learn that CAIR was born out of the now-defunct
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Association_of_Palestine">Islamic Association for
Palestine</a>
(IAP), a group that was started by a top Hamas leader and an
Arab-American university professor that recently pleaded guilty to
aiding the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The same ideology that guided the
IAP is now guiding CAIR. What makes this issue most disturbing is that
instead of putting CAIR on a watch list or disbanding it all together,
the US government has all but recognized it as the legitimate
representative of all Muslims in America. Washington has gone so far as
to grant CAIR <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=CAIRsWork">a seat on the FBI&#8217;s advisory
board</a>, the result
being that America&#8217;s top law enforcement agency cannot move on the
community that by far spawns the most domestic and international
terrorists without first consulting Hamas&#8217; representatives in the US!
While the US is focusing on defeating Islamic terrorism and its state
sponsors abroad, Mohammed&#8217;s cohorts are rapidly positioning themselves
to substantially alter America&#8217;s way of life from within.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a very disturbing report published this week we learn that a female
Palestinian Christian professor from the Gaza Strip has been forced to
convert to Islam by her Muslim university colleagues. WorldNetDaily&#8217;s
Aaron Klein
<a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57019">reports</a>: >
Sana al-Sayegh, head of the Science and Technology Department at Gaza
City&#8217;s Palestine International University, disappeared June 24, failing
to show up at work where she serves as the Gaza Strip&#8217;s only female
doctorate in her field. > > &#8230; > > According to sources close to
her family, about five days after she disappeared Sayegh caller her
parents to say she was being held against her will in order to marry a
Muslim man, who was also a professor at the university. What&#8217;s worse is
that the university&#8217;s president, a known Islamist with ties to Gaza&#8217;s
Hamas rulers, was one of the signatories to Sayegh&#8217;s conversion
certificate, which was delivered to her family by armed Hamas militants
who insisted the conversion was a matter of free will. Of course, this
should not come as too much of a surprise, unless you are among the most
blind of apologists for the Palestinians and Islam in general. Hamas is
a devout Muslim group, and their Koran teaches them that the entire
world must either convert to or be subjugated by Islam. Why not start
with the infidel Christians in their midst? Sayegh returned to work this
week, but has avoided contacting her family, probably under threat of
death, and attempts by her family to contact her new “husband” have
failed. Klein goes on to note that this incident took place just a
little more than a month after a Hamas official said Gaza&#8217;s 2,000
Christians could continue to live there only if they submitted to strict
Islamic law. Very few if any from that tiny community of Christians have
dared to speak openly to the outside world since then. As usual, we must
now ask, where are those champions of personal freedom and human rights
that so readily jump on Israel over every alleged violation, no matter
how minor? Why are the Christians of Gaza not worthy of their aid? With
virtually no opposition, it is only a matter of time before Islam
succeeds (temporarily) in achieving its goals of domination.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Naturally, the Palestinian Authority and Gaza&#8217;s Hamas rulers want to
discredit the notion that Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al Qaeda terrorist network
has set up shop in the territories under their control, but their claims
simply are not compatible with the available evidence. Omedia did a
<a href="http://www.omedia.org/Show_Article.asp?DynamicContentID=2496&amp;MenuID=603&amp;ThreadID=1014010">recent
analysis</a>
showing fairly definitively that the Gaza-based Army of Islam terror
group is a local Al Qaeda branch, and that it is and has for years been
operating in the volatile coastal strip with the approval of first the
Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority and now Hamas. > In an interview
on the Ilaf website (July 17, 2007), Abu Ashour, the right-hand man of
Army of Islam leader Mamtuz Doghmush, said the organization “embraces
the principles in which Al Qaeda believes”&#8230; He noted Al Qaeda sends
money to finance the activity of the Army of Islam, as well as conveying
directives for action. Ashour believes “the decision to [BBC reporter]
kidnap Alan Johnston was made by Al Qaeda &#8216;on the outside&#8217; and the
decision to release him also arrived from &#8216;outside&#8217; in order to avoid
bloodshed.” > > Abu Ashour also revealed the Army of Islam was
established in the Gaza Strip 30 years ago. “At first the Afghans
arrived in order to spread religious awareness,” he said, referring to
Arab fighters who had fought in Afghanistan. “All the Afghans belonged
to Al Qaeda and we called them by their noms de guerre.” That the Army
of Islam operates in Gaza with the approval and even support of the
local rulers became evident last month when Hamas and the Al
Qaeda-linked group worked out a mutually beneficial deal culminating in
Johnston&#8217;s release. While the Army of Islam claims to have been
operating in Gaza for the past 30 years, its recent rise to prominence
is evidence that any territory surrendered by Israel to the Palestinians
will become a haven of global Islamic terrorism. Hamas is already too
entrenched in every area of Palestinian society, be it in Gaza or Judea
and Samaria. That much is clear following Hamas&#8217; landslide municipal and
parliamentary electoral victories over the past three years. Nor has
American backing proved effective is stopping Hamas&#8217; spread and eventual
takeover of areas handed to the Palestinian Authority. If the so-called
“West Bank” is given to the Palestinians, it will eventually be a Hamas
stronghold, just like Gaza. And once that area is in Hamas hands, it
will become a base of operations for Al Qaeda, a new headquarters from
which Osama bin Laden&#8217;s ilk can plan their assault on Judeo-Christian
civilization. Hamas and all the other Palestinian terror groups have
successfully convinced the world that they are not part of the global
Islamic jihad, and that their violence is directed solely against the
“Israeli occupation.” That is why the presence of Al Qaeda is so
detrimental to their current plans. What the Palestinians are trying to
hide is that they ultimately share the ideology being put into action by
Al Qaeda. > The Hamas movement is well aware of the growing power of
the Al Qaeda offshoot and is troubled by the fact that quite a few in
the Hamas military arm and even in its leadership have begun to embrace
the global outlook of Al Qaeda. Hamas members especially are devout
Muslims, and Islam teaches that they must subjugate the entire world,
that all unbelievers must come under Islamic rule via military conquest.
So it should be no surprise that elements within Hamas are starting to
openly embrace Al Qaeda. It&#8217;s no surprise, but it should serve as a
warning. These Hamas boys are just the beginning. Once the Palestinians
have what they want from Israel, they will turn on their benefactors in
the West.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are displaced Palestinian Arabs poor, oppressed refugees, or pawns of
cruel, self-serving Arab leaders? Apparently, that depends on who is
involved in the conflict that displaced them. When Hamas conquered the
Gaza Strip in June, some 6,000 local Arabs fled across the border into
the Egyptian Sinai. On Saturday, the _New York Times_ casually
identified those stranded Arabs as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/world/middleeast/29mideast.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">hapless pawns in a political
struggle</a>.
> For seven weeks now, up to 6,000 Palestinians trying to return to
their homes in the Gaza Strip have been stranded in Egypt, objects of a
political struggle between the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah
involving Israel and Egypt. So when the bad guys in Hamas displace
fellow Arabs, then those victims are pawns because the struggle is
between two Arab entities - Hamas and Fatah. However, when the struggle
is between Arabs and Jews, any Arabs displaced by that struggle are
transformed by the international media into the most pitiable refugee
community in history.</p>
