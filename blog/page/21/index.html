  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much is said about the US pro-Israel lobby, but little is reported on
the pro-Islamic terrorism lobby that is equally trying to influence
America&#8217;s position vis-a-vis the Israeli-Arab conflict and global war on
terror. That probably has a lot to do the Islamic groups not calling
themselves a &#8220;terrorist lobby,&#8221; since they view the terrorists on whose
behalf they are lobbying as &#8220;freedom fighters.&#8221; As we all know, the
mainstream media is only too happy to accept and disseminate that
canard. Whether purposeful cover-up or blissful ignorance on the part of
the media, the fact remains that there are groups in the United States
aligned with &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; and other terrorist organizations pumping
money into the campaigns of Democratic hopefuls in an effort to relieve
Israel of its top ally, among other sinister motives. This phenomenon
was brought to the forefront with Representative Cynthia McKinney&#8217;s
ouster and subsequent <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/290">reelection</a>.
Having succeeded in getting McKinney back in office, it appears the
pro-Palestinian Islamists are looking to buy more Democrats. A 10-minute
reserach session on <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</a>
reveals that one Jesse Aweida and others associated with his <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/aboutus.htm">American
Task Force on Palestine</a>
are pumping money into the campaigns of several Democrats hoping to take
up or maintain residence in Washington this Fall. Thus far in the run-up
to the 2006 election, Aweida has contributed $5,500 to the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee and individual Democratic candidates,
including McKinney (GA), Mark Udall (CO), Bill Winter (CO) and Angela
Paccione (CO). Aweida and the ATFP, while operating under the guise of
respectable Arab-Americans simply concerned for the well-being of all
involved in the Middle East conflict, are in fact apologists for
Palestinian Arab terrorism, and have lobbied on behalf of the killers of
Israeli men, women and children in the past. Most open in his
pro-terrorist views has been Aweida&#8217;s partner, ATFP co-founder and
President Ziad Asali. In 2003, while still president of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Asali <a href="http://adckazoo.com/news-178.htm">wrote a letter
to then-Attorney General John
Ashcroft</a> pressing him to drop all
efforts to deport eight men associated with the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP carried out the 2001 assassination of
Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze&#8217;evi, in addition to numerous other
terrorist attacks. Under Asali&#8217;s leadership, the ADC <a href="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6173">became synonymous
with support for anti-Israel
terrorism</a>.
ATFP Executive Director Rafi Dajani is <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:UzkqS0WxkzkJ:www.wpherald.com/storyview.php%3FStoryID%3D20050920-020502-1360r+%22american+task+force+for+palestine%22+hamas+rice&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6">on
record</a>
deploring the Bush Administration&#8217;s reaction to Hamas&#8217; participation in
Palestinian Authority elections: > &#8220;Denying Hamas the chance to
participate is a sign of weakness. Hamas [the killer of thousands of
Jews] has the right to compete.&#8221; I am sure the handful of candidates
listed above are not the only ones receiving contributions from the
likes of Aweida, Asali and ATFP. It will bode ill for the Jewish state
if these anti-Israel Islamist interests manage to get a few more
McKinneys into the House. But it will bode more ill for the United
States in the long run. It would seem a concerted effort by those who
support Israel and love the true freedom offered by America&#8217;s waning
Judeo-Christian society is required to stop this slide into the Islamic
abyss before it is too late. Much of Europe has already passed the point
of no return. Now, liberals will argue that pro-Palestinian groups have
as much right as pro-Israel groups to contribute to and influence
America&#8217;s lawmakers. But these are the same people who argue that
Palestinian Arab terrorism is no different than Israel&#8217;s counter-terror
military action. Israel is a truly free, democratic nation that punishes
those of its citizens who engage in acts of terrorism, and only seeks to
defend its citizens and provide them with peace and security. The
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; at evey level of government participate in and facilitate
the purposeful mass murder of Israeli Jews as a means of achieving
political goals. To allow interests that support this deplorable
behavior to influence our representatives in Washington is the same as
allowing interests affiliated with the Irish Republican Army to
contribute to congressional campaigns in the name of objectivity and
balance vis-a-vis the Northern Ireland conflict. It is a sick exercise
in the kind of moral equivalency that continues to fuel this conflict.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every wonder why, despite Israel&#8217;s insistance that it goes to tremendous
effort to avoid harming civilians in its war on terror, so many more
Arabs than Jews end up dying in this conflict? This is why: <img src="http://www.zionist.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/HamasHumanShields.jpg" alt="Hamas

Those are children packed in close around Hamas gunmen as they engage

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international community, no doubt strong armed to a certain degree
by the Bush Administration, actually showed a great deal of clarity in
its statement Sunday regarding the escalating situation along the
Israel-Lebanon border. Beirut has been screaming for a ceasefire for
days, urging the world to impose a cessation of hostilities not on
Hizb&#8217;allah, but on Israel. But leaders of the world&#8217;s top industrialized
nations (G-8) meeting in St. Petersburg <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2198687">told
Lebanon</a> it will have
calm only AFTER aggression against the Jewish state ceases. > &#8220;We
demand first that the Israeli soldiers be returned to Israel healthy,
that the attacks on Israel cease, and then naturally for Israel to halt
military action,&#8221; German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/Mideast/story?id=2198066&amp;page=1">perhaps Israel&#8217;s
offensive should go on a bit
longer</a>,
so that when a ceasefire is reached it will be sustainable. And
Britain&#8217;s Tony Blair <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/07/16/afx2881406.html">agreed with
Bush</a>
that the root problem is Syrian and Iranian support for anti-Israel
terror. The only dissenters were <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/22100">France&#8217;s Jacque Chirac and Russia&#8217;s
Vladimir Putin</a>, who unsurprisingly
accused Israel of going too far in what their skewed view of the world
tells them is Israel&#8217;s quest to destroy Lebanon. More: <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1103AP_G8_Summit_Text.html">Full text of the

the World Press Federation after that organization condemned the Jewish
state for bombing a television station belonging to Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
_Al-Manar_ network. In an unbelievable statement, Federation
Secretary-General Aidan White said: > The attacks on _Al-Manar_

organizations with which Israel does not agree. It is amazing how
freedom of speech now extends to terrorist ranting and incitement to

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international media has been gloomily and loudly repeating the
mounting civilian death toll in Lebanon. And yet, no mention of the
number of Hizb&#8217;allah casualties, which must be far greater than civilian
casualties since Israel is carefully and specifically targeting
Hizb&#8217;allah. Nasrallah and his cronies are purposely keeping those
numbers secret. Leave it to the media to play right into Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
hands by <a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1153061738.shtml">failing to mention this
fact</a>. Also largely ignored is
the fact Hizb&#8217;allah has placed its most strategic positions as close to
civilian centers as possible. In many cases, stockpiles of missiles have
been hidden in homes!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hizb&#8217;allah chief Hassan Nasrallah Sunday said his group&#8217;s only desire to
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3276791,00.html">protect the people of
Lebanon</a>. But
the people of Lebanon are today enduring a punishing Israeli military
offensive ONLY because Hizb&#8217;allah decided to launch an unprovoked
assault on northern Israel. Before that assault, there were no Israeli
bombs or shells landing in Lebanon. Plain and simple. If Nasrallah
really cared about the well-being of Lebanon&#8217;s people above all else, he
would set free the IDF soldiers abducted by Hizb&#8217;allah and withdraw his
forces from southern Lebanon. But like all Arab leaders who shed
crocodile tears over the suffering of their people, Nasrallah&#8217;s true aim
is to help facilitate the annihilation of Israel. It is a pattern that
was established long ago with the cynical use of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; refugees
scattered throughout the region, who have been left in an unsettled
state for decades. Like those &#8220;refugees&#8221;, the people of Lebanon can rest
assured that Nasrallah and his cause can only benefit from their
suffering and deaths.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears Hizb&#8217;allah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, having lost his
home and office in an Israeli air raid, has taken up residence in loony
land, severely impairing his ability to distinguish between the actions
and motivation of his own forces and those of the Israelis. <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3276773,00.html">Said
Nasrallah</a>
(Hebrew) in a press conference Sunday: > Hizb&#8217;allah is attacking only
Israeli military targets and &#8220;is making every effort to not harm
civilians,&#8221; whereas Israel is hitting only civilian targets, &#8220;civilians
- and not [our] missile stockpiles.&#8221; I am pretty sure the residents of
Haifa, Tsfat (Safed), Kiryat Shemonah, Metulla, Tiberias, etc would take
issue with that assertion. He continued: > &#8220;One side is acting with
reason. Contrary to the stupidity that is driving the other side.&#8221;
Tellingly, there is not one Arab state outside of Syria that is backing
Hizb&#8217;allah at this point. Even Saudi Arabia, certainly no friend of
Israel, has slammed Hizb&#8217;allah for engaging in &#8220;irresponsible
adventurism&#8221; that caused the current crisis. > &#8220;We just want to protect
our people.&#8221; Right. And you do that by provoking a fight with a superior
power. Sadly, Nasrallah&#8217;s words will be taken at face value by many in
the international media, and therefore by their readers.</p>
