  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s leadership is <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/783700.html">making the predictable
error</a> of being dragged
into a process of thinking it can deal with PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) and talk peace with him, while somehow bypassing the
democratically-elected representatives of the Palestinian Arabs - the
Hamas terrorist organization. The Olmert government and its friends in
Washington posit that by making concessions to Abbas, his star will rise
among the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; at the expense of Hamas&#8217; vast popularity. Even
a cursory glance at recent history would dispel that theory, however.
Israel and the West made nearly every conceivable concession to Yasser
Arafat and Abbas in the years prior to Hamas&#8217; landslide electoral win.
And that didn&#8217;t stop the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; from voting for terror. The
lesson that must be learned here, and the lesson that Israel and the US
are doing their best to ignore, is that when it comes to winning
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; votes (or votes anywhere in the Muslim world), nothing
works like slaughtering Jews. The mantle of international statesmanship
placed on the shoulders of Arafat and Abbas meant far less to the
average Palestinian Arab than did Hamas&#8217; Jewish body count. But having
entered the realm of politics, Hamas appears to be <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1361">learning to play the
game</a>, further decreasing the
chances that either Israel or the US will see the &#8220;Palestinian cause&#8221;
for its true intentions. On Sunday, Hamas Foreign Minister Mahmoud
al-Zahar suggested that his government would back an international peace
conference based on an Arab peace proposal that demands Israel surrender
every inch of land liberated in 1967. Western governments and the
international media are expected to faint from excitement, while
ignoring statements made by Zahar just hours earlier to the effect that
while Hamas would be willing to respond to calls for peace by offering
Israel a long-term truce, it would absolutely under no circumstances
ever recognize the Jewish state&#8217;s right to exist. So, in return for
bowing to all current Arab demands, Israel will receive a few years of
relative quiet followed by a storm of violence launched from commanding
positions that Israel itself provided for Hamas and its allies. Sounds
like a real winner. Despite the obvious absurdity of this scenario,
Zahar and Hamas know that the US-led international community is hungry
for progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front - what with all the
troubles in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon - and they are playing directly to
this desire. Just like with Arafat, the world, including America, can be
soon expected to start ignoring the violent diatribes of Hamas leaders,
while focusing only on those statements that give even the faintest hope
for the signing of a scrap of paper labeled &#8220;peace.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
<a href="http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2006/special-reports/061003-rice-travels.html">suggested</a>
following talks with her Saudi counterpart on Tuesday that the Arab
world has come to a concensus on the need to recognize Israel&#8217;s right to
exist as the Jewish state. Either Rice is visiting a Middle East in some
parallel universe, or she is severely out of touch with the will of the
Arab street. As a first example, let&#8217;s take Hamas, which was the subject
of Rice&#8217;s comments. The secretary noted that Hamas was in fact duly
elected by a majority of &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; She then noted that Hamas is
bringing hardship on the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; because of its failure to join
the regional concensus on accepting Israel. But if a majority, and an
overwhelming majority at that, elected Hamas on a platform of rejecting
Israel, wouldn&#8217;t that suggest that the concensus among &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; is
that Israel has to go? <a href="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/article_1202471.php/Most_Palestinians_think_Hamas_should_not_recognize_Israel_poll">Recent opinion
polls</a>
showing that the Palestinian Arab public does not want Hamas to
&#8220;moderate&#8221; its views support this assessment. Or how about in Lebanon?
Of all of Israel&#8217;s closest Arab neighbors, Lebanon probably has the most
citizens who support Israel. Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands in a
nation of only several million <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/22/lebanon.rally.reut/">turned out last month in
Beirut</a>
for a rally in support of Hizb&#8217;allah and its mission to destroy Israel.
I don&#8217;t think we need to even touch on Syria, a nation where some of the
most vile anti-Semitic blood libels still constitute <a href="http://jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/000361.php">prime-time
television
programming</a>. Few
would back the claim that Iraqi Arabs are keen to recognize the Jewish
state simply because Saddam is now gone. In fact, just this summer their
&#8220;moderate&#8221; prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki,
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/26/AR2006072600230.html">refused</a>
during a meeting with US congressional leaders to denounce Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
use of terrorist violence against Israel. Jordan&#8217;s King Abdullah II is a
smooth, educated man who easily wins the hearts and minds of most who
hear him. But the disdain for Israel felt by most Jordanians has been
made abundantly clear by the
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/627">remarks</a> and
<a href="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/10292000001.htm">actions</a> of Jordanian
lawmakers and religious officials over the years. Egypt has been at
&#8220;peace&#8221; with Israel longer than any other Arab state, but Israeli
efforts to forge a warm relationship with their southern neighbor have
proved to be in vain. As an example of Egyptian hatred for Israel,
consider that the most popular song in Egypt for years was a little tune
titled <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/07/MN6076.DTL">&#8220;I hate
Israel.&#8221;</a>
Arab leaders will say almost anything to their Western benefactors to
ensure that the flow of dollars and weapons continues. For this they are
labeled &#8220;moderates.&#8221; But their lip-service absolutely does not mean that
the Arab masses accept what Islam teaches them must be seen as an
infidel cancer in the midst of their Muslim homeland.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>US President George W. Bush said following the September 11, 2001
attacks on his nation that from hence forth there could be no
distinction between terrorist killers and the people and nation&#8217;s who
harbor, finance and support them. If that is the case, then everyone has
got to stop treating the Palestinian Arabs with kid gloves! <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3308421,00.html">Yet another
poll</a> shows
that the vast majority of Palestinians support terrorist violence
against Israel (and probably against the US, too). The results this time
around should be of particular interest to the Bush administration,
which went to great lengths to brand Hizb&#8217;allah an illegitimate
terrorist entity during the recent war. Jointly conducted by both
Israeli and Palestinian pollsters, the survey reveals that a significant
65 percent majority of Palestinian Arabs want their own terror groups to
start following Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s example by shelling major Israeli
population centers. Yes, that is right, the overwhelming majority of
average Palestinians want this. Furthermore, greater than 75 percent of
Palestinians would like to see an increase in terrorist abductions of
Israelis. A firm 57 percent majority still backs suicide bombings, but
we already knew that. Again, these are the people Israel is being asked
to make peace with. And it&#8217;s not just a radical fringe that thinks this
way. No, it&#8217;s the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian public at
large. Even if they truly believe they are fighting a legitimate battle
for legitimate rights (which the poll also indicated), advocating
terrorist violence as a means of achieving those goals is just wrong.
What&#8217;s worse, these poll numbers suggest that future generations of
Palestinians are being brought up to hate, and to murder in most vicious
fashion the objects of their hate. The warning to the world, and
Washington especially, is that you are complicit in this catastrophe. By
failing to hold the Palestinians accountable for their behavior, you are
encouraging them to continue down this path of death and destruction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem Saturday indicated his nation is
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1157913688187&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">ready to resume some kind of peace
process</a>
with Israel. That news got Israeli ultra-leftists, some foreign
diplomats, and the mainstream media all excited. But this purported
peace overture must be seen as a deception, just like every one before
it. First of all, it was not made in a spirit of mutual responsibility
and bilateral give-and-take. Rather, al-Mualem indicated the peace
process must be resumed on Arab terms, which the international community
will have to impose upon Israel and its American allies. > &#8220;If (the
international community) has the desire and the decisiveness to do so,
it could turn this into a real chance for peace, and fix the region&#8217;s
problems. If the international community decides not to, because of
Israeli and dominating US pressure, I am certain that this opportunity
will be lost.&#8221; Second, Damascus continues to harbor and assist
organizations openly dedicated to the destruction of Israel, such as
Hamas, which has its international headquarters in the Syrian capital.
As Israel has communicated repeatedly, if Syria was truly interested in
a true peace, it would end its relationship with such groups. One must
also keep in mind that had the Lebanon war ended differently - say, with
Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s demise at the hands of Israel - Syria would not be talking
&#8220;peace,&#8221; but urging the international community to censure Israel, or
worse. The Arab world is only ready to talk because it perceives Israel
has having been defeated, or at least held at bay, by a far inferior
military force. It&#8217;s peace overtures must be seen in this light. There
is an underlying belief throughout the Arab world that Israel is finally
weak enough to be defeated militarily. The only thing that remains is
for the Arabs to get their pieces set in advantageous positions.
Israel&#8217;s control of the dominating Golan Heights and the central hill
regions of Judea and Samaria pose nearly insurmountable defensive
hurdles. If Israel can be strongarmed through negotiations to surrender
these areas, and its military is still perceived as too weak even to
crush Hizb&#8217;allah, it will be only a matter of time (and a very short
matter of time at that) until the next pan-Arab effort to annihilate the
Jewish state. Their appetites are whetted. Will the world help to set
the table?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This time in Egypt. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766387.html">Cairo is
banning</a> the most
recent editions of popular French and German newspapers for publishing
editorials delving into Islam&#8217;s violent history and the behavior of its
founder, the &#8220;prophet&#8221; Mohammed. As reported by Egypt&#8217;s state-controlled
news agency, MENA: > &#8220;The minister of information said that he would
not allow any publication that insults the Islamic religion or calls for
hatred or contempt of any religion to be distributed inside Egypt.&#8221; This
statement will certainly seem odd to anyone familiar with the
<a href="http://www.adl.org/egyptian_media/old_egyptian_conspiracy.asp">huge</a>
<a href="http://www.netanyahu.org/anandholdeni.html">amount</a>

on a regular basis by Egyptian newspapers, radio stations and television
networks. <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/publications/endangered/">Nor are Christians spared the incitement to
hatred</a>.
Now, some will point to the fact that many of the examples of
anti-Semitism in the Egyptian media take the form of political criticism
of Israel, the Jewish state, making the virulent statements, cartoons
and programs perfectly legitimate. But if that is true, is it not
equally legitimate in today&#8217;s world to look at, question and even
criticize Islam&#8217;s violent origins and history? After all, almost all of
the major armed conflicts taking place in the world today involve
Muslims who claim to be acting on behalf of Allah.</p>

real</a> with
participants in last week&#8217;s counter-terrorism conference in Herzliya
about why true peace between Israel and the Arab world just isn&#8217;t ever
going to happen. While Israel and the West do their best to separate
religion and the governing of the state, Professor Moshe Sharon
explained that in the Middle East, Islam is everything, influences
everything, is the basis of everything. > &#8220;The root of the problem
between us and the Arab world is Islam,&#8221; which views Israel&#8217;s rebirth as
an unacceptable &#8220;reversal of history.&#8221; As such, peace agreements between
Israel and its Muslim neighbors can never be anything more than &#8220;pieces
of paper, parts of tactics, strategies&#8221; that have &#8220;no meaning&#8221; so far as
true peace is concerned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most parents know that when a child gets overly defensive, he is usually
guilty of the wrongdoing he is being accused of. The same is certainly
true with adults, as well as whole people groups. Take for instance the
Muslim world&#8217;s wild overreaction first to the <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=19322&amp;only">publication of a
political cartoon featuring the Prophet
Mohammed</a>,
then to Pope Benedict XVI&#8217;s <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/09/16/D8K602M80.html">attempt to emphasize the incompatibility of
violence and
faith</a> in a
university lecture during which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who
denounced Mohammed&#8217;s calls for jihad. (Of particular note are the
&#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; who have apparently grown so used to their violent ways
being excused that they are <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3304545,00.html">openly attacking Christian
churches</a> in
response to the pope&#8217;s remarks.) If Islam really is tolerant and
advocates peace, then why do its practitioners react in such ways over
what are in reality very minor provocations? The media and Muslim
clerics in this part of the world make a regular habit of denouncing and
bad mouthing Jews and Christians, but the result is never widespread
Jewish or Christian violence against Muslims. If you want people to
believe that you are tolerant and non-violent, then it is best to not
respond to accusations of violence with violence. To do so incidcates
that you are in fact guilty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Contrary to its nature, Amnesty International has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1157913624738&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">released a
report</a>
accusing a Muslim entity of committing war crimes against the Jewish
state. The &#8220;human rights&#8221; group rightly says that Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s rocket
barrages against northern Israel this summer, which purposely targeted
civilian population centers, were in violation of international law. The
organization also rightly rejected Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s counter-claim that the
rocket attacks were merely reprisals for Israeli aggression against
Lebanon. It will be interesting to see if Amnesty and those affiliated
with and influenced by it now seek to prosecute Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah
and other Hizb&#8217;allah officials in the same way they do alleged Israeli
war criminals. I wonder also if Amnesty will read enough of the <a href="http://www.genevaconventions.org/">Geneva
Conventions</a> to realize that, while
regrettable, the deaths of so many Lebanese at the hands of Israeli
forces does not constitute a violation of international law since
Hizb&#8217;allah was using the civilian population as a shield (Convention IV,
Art. 28). A nation has a right to defend itself against deadly
aggression, even if its attacker is hiding behind innocents, and Geneva
recognizes that right. But maybe I am getting ahead of myself. We cannot
expect too much balance from Amnesty all at once.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Again, the international media and many Western government are jumping
the gun, and mistaking Hamas&#8217; efforts to secure financial aid as an
indication the terror group is suddenly ready to abandon its core
positions and live in peaceful coexistence with Israel. The source of
the misguided enthusiasm this time is <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761369.html">news of an imminent Palestinian
Authority unity
government</a>, under the
terms of which Hamas appears to be indirectly recognizing the Jewish
state. But it is not peace that is driving this move. Rather it is the
crushing economic sanctions the PA has been living under since Hamas
took over the government in January. Hamas has seen its popularity
plummet after being unable to pay over 150,000 PA employees for the past
half year. The group is desperate to secure funds. But certainly not
desperate enough to renounce the virulent hatred for and brutal violence
against Israel that brought it to power. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761475.html">Asked by Israel&#8217;s Army
Radio</a> if Hamas&#8217;
implicit acceptance of negotiations with Israel signalled an &#8220;end to the
conflict,&#8221; Hamas government spokesman Ghazi Hamad said Tuesday: >
&#8220;That&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re saying. We have no problem accepting a state with
the 1967 borders.&#8221; However, &#8220;We are not willing to recognize Israel.
This is our country.&#8221; A day earlier, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri
<a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7004830411">told Ha&#8217;aretz</a>: >
&#8220;We would like to have the embargo lifted, but we will not surrender to
external dictates and we will not agree to sacrifice the interests and
rights of the Palestinian people.&#8221; The left-wing Israeli newspaper <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761476.html">also
noted</a> that the draft
unity government proposal also provides for Hamas to reject any previous
agreements between Israel and the PA that it feels do not &#8220;serve
Palestinian interests.&#8221; And while it does call for a halt to acts of
terror inside sovereign Israel, the deal gives a green light for
continued violence against Jews living in Judea and Samaria.
Unfortunately, the international community, and in particular the
mainstream media, continue to see only what they want to see, rather
than listening to what Hamas has to say or actually reading the
documents that are purportedly forming the base of future peace and
stability.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Excepting the period of Napolean&#8217;s reign, French arrogance and naivety
regarding their neighbors and the world at large have only brought
defeat for that proud nation over the past several hundred years. And
now the French expect the rest of the West to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060907/wl_afp/mideastusterrorism">follow their
lead</a>
when it comes to dealing with global Islamic terror. Said French Prime
Minister Dominique de Villepin to the French National Assembly last
week: > &#8220;Against terrorism, it is not a war that has to be fought, but
&#8211; as France has done for years &#8211; a determined struggle based on
constant vigilance and effective cooperation with our partners.&#8221; But
those &#8220;partners&#8221; he speaks of - entities like Syria, Iran, the
Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, etc - are the very ones
facilitating terrorism! Cooperation with them will only embolden them to
continue playing the terror card, even if discreetly. Villepin went on
to absolve the practitioners of terrorism of all guilt by claiming the
phenomenon is an alien concept that has attached itself to real crises
in order to spur senseless violence. He then played apologist for Al
Qaeda, Hizb&#8217;allah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, etc by suggesting those crises
were in fact justification for terrorist violence against the party
purportedly causing the grievance. > &#8220;We will never bring this plague
to an end except by also fighting against injustice, violence, against
crises.&#8221; But Villepin really took the cake with his concluding
statement: > &#8220;It is the duty of France and Europe to show that the
clash of civilizations is not an inevitability. It is only we &#8211; French
and Europeans &#8211; who bear this wisdom inherited from history.&#8221;
Ironically, France, under Emperor Charlemagne, was the first European
power to repulse Islam&#8217;s long desire to overrun the Christian-dominated
continent, in what is and always has been a &#8220;clash of civilizations.&#8221; To
follow the advice of France&#8217;s modern leadership is to play right into
the hands of Allah and his followers. In light of the past century of
French blunders and defeats, we should know better.</p>
