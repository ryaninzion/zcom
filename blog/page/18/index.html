  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan and the international community are <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/747774.html">so
busy</a> trying to find
Israeli violations of international law in the current fighting, they
are completely ignoring daily war crimes being committed by Hizb&#8217;allah.
First their is the obvious crime of launching attacks on a neighboring
state from populated areas, purposely putting unarmed civilians in
harm&#8217;s way. Then there is Hizb&#8217;allah indiscriminate shelling of Israeli
civilian population centers. But within that violation there is an even
more serious crime - the brutal nature of the weapons being employed by
Hizb&#8217;allah. While visiting northern Israel Saturday, we witnessed a
Katyusha strike on the northern suburbs of Haifa. Arriving at the impact
site of two rockets, we noted how the thousands of ballbearings packed
into each warhead - which were scattered about the scene - had caused
damage to buildings and cars up to 100 yards away. The anti-personnel
function of these weapons is clear, and the fact they are being used
against a civilian population should be cause for outrage, not only in
Israel but also in the halls of the UN. It is nothing short of
miraculous that hundreds more Israelis have not been killed and wounded
by these weapons. The world needs to stop looking at body counts, and
start paying attention to intent. Israel&#8217;s intent is to destroy a
terrorist infrastructure with global reach while avoiding civilian
casualties as much as possible. Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s intent to to mass murder
Israeli civilians by launching anti-personnel weapons into crowded
population centers. The latter is a war crime, the former is not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan and his buddies at the UN are daily fretting over the
mounting humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, pointing to the hundreds of
thousands of people displaced by Israel&#8217;s military operations against
Hizb&#8217;allah. Meanwhile, the two million residents of Israel&#8217;s northern
regions who have either been forced from their homes or into cramped
bomb shelters by incessant Hizb&#8217;allah rocket fire are virtually
forgotten. With the conflict dragging on longer than most had hoped,
many can no longer afford to stay away, and find themselves forced to
return north, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/747767.html">full of fear and
despair</a>, putting
themselves and their children in harm&#8217;s way. Forgive me for playing the
anti-Semitism card once again, but this smacks of precisely the attitude
of the international community as Jews were being slaughtered in their
millions by the Nazis during World War II. Then, too, the world did its
best to ignore the Jewish humanitarian crisis until it had no choice but
to acknowledge it due to the horrendous death toll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Lebanese government, in what news agencies described as an
&#8220;extraordinary&#8221; event, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287927,00.html">decided
unanimously</a>
Monday to deploy up to 15,000 troops in southern Lebanon, provided
Israel withdraw its forces first. That decision is also certain to cause
excitement in Washington and the capitals of Europe, as well as the
halls of the UN. But weren&#8217;t all of these world leaders telling us just
a few weeks ago that the Lebanese army was too weak to confront
Hizb&#8217;allah, and therefore could not be held directly accountable for the
terrorist aggression that sparked the current crisis? Is that still
true, or has the Lebanese military suddenly become a powerful and
capable fighting force? If it is the former, then who cares if Lebanon
sends its army south at this point. Without a force capable of removing
the Hizb&#8217;allah threat to northern Israel, this whole war is just going
to repeat itself a few months or years down the road. In fact, Beirut is
attempting to deceive the international community, even as Lebanon&#8217;s
political and military leaderships make no secret of their support and
admiration for Hizb&#8217;allah. Immediately following Monday&#8217;s cabinet
decision, Lebanese Information Minister Ghazi Aridi refused to answer in
the affirmative a reporter&#8217;s question on whether the troops being sent
south would be tasked with disarming and removing Hizb&#8217;allah from the
border regions. That should have sent up red flags right away. Shortly
after, a senior government source indicated to Reuters that Beirut had
taken the decision with the sole intention of forcing a revision of the
US-France draft ceasefire proposal, which it sees as being too in line
with Israel&#8217;s position on how to end the fighting. On one point there
should be no confusion: If Lebanon deploys its army to the south, it
will *not* prevent Hizb&#8217;allah attacks on Israel by forces of arms. Nor
will Hizb&#8217;allah see the deployment as a true deterrent to its aggression
against the Jewish state. All this move will accomplish is to provide
Hizb&#8217;allah with additional human shields, and to deter future Israeli
defensive operations for fear of having to engage its neighbor&#8217;s
official armed forces and thereby sparking a wider regional conflict.
<a href="http://www.zionist.com/2006/08/06/israel-needs-to-declare-war-on-lebanon">Remarks by the head of Lebanon&#8217;s military and statements on the army&#8217;s

to the effect that Hizb&#8217;allah is a *strategic national asset* would
suggest that is precisely Beirut&#8217;s aim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www1.idf.il/SIP_STORAGE/DOVER/files/3/55363.wmv">This video</a>
shows Hizb&#8217;allah firing multiple rockets at northern Israel from the
southern Lebanon village of Qana, as well as storing its arms in
buildings and houses in that community. When Israel hits these villages
with intense airstrikes, it is not out of aggression, but self defense.
Israel, like every other nation, has the right to return fire on the
origin of fire against its own civilians. If and when Lebanese civilians
lose their lives as a result of this series of events, their blood is
first and foremost on Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s hands, for obvious reasons. After
Hizb&#8217;allah, the civilians themselves are most responsible for their own
deaths for not leaving the area despite being warned by Israel for days
prior to the airstrikes to do so. Israel may regret these civilian
deaths, but it bears no responsibility whatsoever for collateral damage
incurred during defense strikes against the origin of fire on its
sovereign territory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite strong speeches by its leaders and what appeared to be an
initial recognition of the necessity for outright victory against
Hizb&#8217;allah, Israel now appears unable to do what is needed to actually
achieve that goal. _Ha&#8217;aretz_ correspondent <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/747071.html">Ze&#8217;ev Schiff
warns</a> that if the IDF
and political echelon do not get on the same page soon and implement a
strong and unified battle plan, the conflict with Hizb&#8217;allah will turn
into a war of attrition, bringing the Galilee region to its knees. IDF
Northern Command says it has a plan for victory, but it seems the Olmert
government, which insists on approving every small step in this war
before it is taken, has delayed implementation of the winning strategy
as it looks over its shoulder to see what the international community is
saying. Cabinet meetings are turning into endless debates with no
decisions taken the longer this fight drags on, putting victory further
out of reach every day. It doesn&#8217;t matter how many Hizb&#8217;allah men Israel
kills or how many of the terrorists&#8217; rockets are destroyed. Hizb&#8217;allah
can recruit more willing fighters, and Iran and Syria will gladly supply
more arms. All Hizb&#8217;allah has to do to win this fight is survive and
demonstrate an ability to continue threatening northern Israel when all
is said and done. The burden of proof, therefore, is on Israel. Will
Israel deal Hizb&#8217;allah and its sponsors such a harsh blow that despite
the ability to recruit more men and obtain more weapons the group would
never dare to use them again? Or will ultimate victory elude Jerusalem,
leading to an irreversible tarnishing of the IDF&#8217;s image has the
region&#8217;s mightiest military force and the deterrence that perception so
long provided against Muslim aggression?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Condi Rice today claimed that Iraq is en route to becoming one of
America&#8217;s strongest and most fierce allies in the global war on terror,
by virtue of the fact its population has suffered so much terror lately.
But her theory has one gaping hole. You see, America has created a
democracy, or at least planted the seeds of democracy, in Iraq, and
democracies are governments by the people, for the people. It is citizen
rule. And when the majority sector of the citizenry is widly supportive
of anti-American and anti-Israel terrorism (as evidenced by recent
demonstrations), you can be sure that their elected officials are not
going to go to war against the perpetrators of that terrorism. Rice also
asserts that last Friday&#8217;s massive pro-Hizb&#8217;allah rally in Baghdad was a
positive development (despite the fact she didn&#8217;t like what was said)
because it shows that free speech has been established in a nation once
under the iron fist of a tyrannical dictator. With all due respect,
chants of &#8220;Death to America&#8221; and &#8220;Death to Israel&#8221; are not the kind of
&#8220;free speech&#8221; you want or even should allow. Even in the US, where free
speech is king, it is unlawful to advocate or call for the annihilation
of a nation or people group.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel needs to wake up and declare war on the nation of Lebanon, rather
than focus its military efforts solely on the Hizb&#8217;allah terrorist
organization. The reasons are many, but the more important ones include
the fact that successive Lebanese governments, including the current
democratically-elected one, have allowed Hizb&#8217;allah to arm, flourish,
take control of parts of the country and launch attacks on a neighboring
state. Lebanon is still officially in a state of war with Israel, and
according to <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=/SpecialReports/archive/200608/SPE20060802a.html">comments by Lebanon&#8217;s president and official statements by
its armed
forces</a>,
Hizb&#8217;allah is an invaluable strategic asset in that war. Lebanese
President Emil Lahoud had this to say of Hizb&#8217;allah last week: >
&#8220;Hizb&#8217;allah enjoys utmost prestige in Lebanon, because it freed our
country.&#8221; The commander of Lebanon&#8217;s army, Gen. Michel Suleiman, added
to that in a public speech: > Ongoing cooperation between the army and
Hizb&#8217;allah &#8220;guarantees &#8230; the country&#8217;s unity.&#8221; The army&#8217;s official
website states: > &#8220;Preserving this resistance (Hizb&#8217;allah) constitutes
a Lebanese strategic interest.&#8221; In an statement released to the nation
last year marking the Lebanese army&#8217;s 60th anniversary, protecting and
harboring Hizb&#8217;allah was described as &#8220;a national and moral obligation&#8221;
that works in &#8220;the country&#8217;s and the people&#8217;s interest.&#8221; And it is to
these people that the US Congress wants to give an additional $10
million of its taxpayers&#8217; dollars in the hope Lebanon&#8217;s army can be
bolstered enough to confront Hizb&#8217;allah? What we have is a group of
heavily-armed people that enjoy the support of their nation&#8217;s president
and armed forces in attacking and provoking conflict with a neighboring
state. In any other part of the world, that constitutes an act of war by
one nation against another. Focusing solely on Hizb&#8217;allah and treating
it as a crime syndicate rather than an official proxy of Lebanon&#8217;s and
the Muslim world&#8217;s war against the Jewish state is helping no one.
Israel and its American allies need to be declaring war on Lebanon as a
supporter of the wrong side in the global war on terror, not throwing
more money at it. The &#8220;Cedar Revolution&#8221; so praised by Rice and others
counts for nothing if all it did was create yet another terror
supporting regime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The continued description of the Palestinian Arabs as anyone&#8217;s peace

&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; in the Samarian town of Shechem <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287112,00.html">erupted in mass
celebration</a>
Sunday upon hearing of the deaths of 10 Israeli reservists in a
Hizb&#8217;allah missile strike in northern Israel. Fireworks were set off,
rifles were fired in the air, and candies were passed out to kids - the
same kids that will one day be expected by Israel and the West to live
in peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. Yeah, right. Oh, and by
the way America, all those millions you are pumping into the Palestinian
Authority are not buying many hearts and minds. They roared with
delight, too, when 3,000 of your own were slaughtered by Osama bin
Laden&#8217;s minions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems Israel&#8217;s bombing of Beirut was not intense enough for Beirut, so
they published some doctored photos to make the destruction appear more
widespread. Charles over at Little Green Footballs has a <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=21956_Reuters_Doctoring_Photos_from_Beirut&amp;only">long, in-depth
post</a>
on the issue with a series of examples, so I will not repost and rehash
here what is already being hammered throughout the conservative
blogosphere. Suffice it to say this is not the first time the MSM has
willfully disseminated such distortions in its quest to discredit
Israel. <a href="http://vitalperspective.typepad.com/vital_perspective_clarity/2006/07/reports_destruc.html">This
map</a>
of Beirut shows that while the MSM would have you believe the entire
city is being obliterated, Israel is in fact attacking only a very small
corner of the Lebanese capital, leaving 99% of it virtually untouched.
Nor is the phenomenon isolated to the current Israel-Hizb&#8217;allah
conflict. When Israel really went after &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists during
Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, the Palestinian Authority told the
MSM that the town of Jenin was being flattened and its citizens
massacred by the Israelis. The story was reported as dictated. But
<a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/4/Aerial%20Photographs%20of%20Jenin">aerial
photographs</a>
of Jenin later released by the IDF showed that the fighting and
destruction in that city had in fact been confined to an extremely small
area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel has lost a fair number of its finest young soldiers during the
current war in Lebanon. How they died certainly varies from individual
to individual, but recent accounts of how Major Roi Klein died while
leading his troops against Hizb&#8217;allah in Bint Jbeil is characteristic of
other stories I have heard about the conduct of seasoned Israeli
commanders who possess a deep sense of what they are fighting for.
According to personal accounts of some of the soldiers present in the
fierce battle on July 26, Klein not only displayed tremendous
self-sacrifice by falling on a grenade lobbed at his platoon, but made
sure the last thing he did in this life was honor God by reciting the
Sh&#8217;ma - &#8220;Here Oh Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is One.&#8221; The spirit
of Israel&#8217;s great biblical warriors appears to be alive and well in this
nation.</p>
