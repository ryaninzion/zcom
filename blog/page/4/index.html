  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Bush Administration is trying to kick-start the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process and is pouring US taxpayers&#8217; dollars into Palestinian
Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; Fatah organization based on the myth
that Hamas has been sidelined and isolated in Gaza, and that Abbas and
Fatah want nothing to do with their Islamist brothers. That is what
Washington is selling those Americans whose hard-earned tax dollars are
going to the Palestinians, but the White House and the State Department
know better. They are, in fact, financing Islamic terrorism against a US
ally. A report in WorldNetDaily today revealed that Fatah&#8217;s “military
wing” the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades remains fully engaged in terrorist
activity against Israel. And not only that, the Brigades are actually
<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57326">teaming up with Hamas to carry out attacks on
Israelis</a>.
It should be noted that nearly every member of the Al Aqsa Brigades is
also a member of Abbas&#8217; Palestinian Authority police force that the US
is putting so much effort into training and equipping. So what does this
news say of the assumption that Fatah hates Hamas after the latter
forcibly took over Gaza earlier this summer, and that the US is helping
those forces loyal to Abbas so that they can defeat Hamas? The truth is
that the internal struggle between Fatah and Hamas is aimed at
determining who is the big dog in the Palestinian-controlled
territories. Neither Fatah nor Hamas intends to eliminate the other from
the scene. If and when Fatah asserts absolute dominance in Judea and
Samaria, there will be even greater cooperation with Hamas. They just
need to show who is the boss, and then they can resume working together.
None of this has anything to do with providing security for Israel in
line with the peace process. Fatah and Hamas are not divided on their
hate-saturated view of the Jewish state. The money the US is pumping
into Fatah is today being used by those elements within the organization
who are already prepared to work with Hamas against Israel. And the rest
of Fatah will follow in the near future, putting those new US-provided
weapons and combat techniques to good use in the murder of even more
Israeli Jews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mainstream support in the US and Europe for the global war on terror is
still fairly easy to come by when the enemy is a rogue, independent
group like Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al Qaeda. It becomes more of a challenge
when dealing with groups like Lebanon&#8217;s Hizballah and the Palestinian
movement Hamas. Both Hizballah and Hamas are recognized by most
governments in the West as terrorist organizations. Nevertheless, many
of those same Western governments today advocate engaging the groups in
dialogue due to the fact that both are also involved in local
government. The two primary arguments for that position are: 1.
Hizballah and Hamas (and other similar groups) are an inescapable
reality and integral part of their respective societies that cannot be
ignored; 2. Unlike Al Qaeda, Hizballah and Hamas are localized
resistance movements, despite their frequent verbal identification with
a global Islamic outlook. The first argument is a cop-out by nations
that either are wary of sparking a clash of civilizations they refuse to
believe is already in full swing, or are too afraid of afraid of their
own Muslim minorities to be seen siding with a non-Muslim entity against
Muslim groups. Hizballah and Hamas have become integral parts of their
respective societies precisely because the dominant powers that be have
refused to make it clear that support for such groups is unacceptable.
And I don&#8217;t mean by merely placing these groups on lists of recognized
terrorist organizations. I mean by making the populations that harbor
and support them really _feel_ that they are paying too high a price
for doing so. The second argument sets an extremely dangerous precedent
that can only lead to the perpetuation of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
Hizballah and Hamas are on Western lists of recognized terrorist
organizations because they engage in tactics that are terrorist in
nature in order to achieve their political goals. Granting them any
degree of legitimacy will only encourage Hizballah, Hamas and other
“resistance movements” around the world to continue committing
atrocities so long as their underlying cause is acceptable to the
international community. Take as an example a recent report that the
United Nations is favorably considering a Lebanese proposal to <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1187502427231&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">redraw
the Israel-Lebanon
border</a>
in accordance with Lebanese and Hizballah demands in order to avoid
future conflict. The international community is critical of Hizballah&#8217;s
assault on northern Israel that led to last summer&#8217;s war, but is now
signaling that it accepts Lebanon&#8217;s claim that a small piece of the
Golan Heights controlled by Israel is in fact Lebanese territory, which
was Hizballah&#8217;s justification for attacking in the first place. When all
is said and done, Hizballah is going to brush off the international
community&#8217;s anger over its tactics and hold up as a prize the fact that
its assault on Israel led to the UN reversing an earlier decision in
order to meet its demands. And that is going to provide enormous
encouragement to every terrorist organization everywhere that is
employing terrorist violence to achieve political gains.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596980281?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=zionistcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1596980281">_The Truth About Muhammad: Founder of the

by Robert Spencer, and want to encourage anyone interested in a deeper
examination of why Muslims are today at the center of the vast majority
of conflicts around the world to pick up a copy. Spencer notes that,
just as Jesus is the ultimate model for Christians, Mohammed represents
for Muslims the perfect example of how a servant of Allah is to conduct
his or herself. As such, in order to gain a better understanding of why
modern Islamic claims to be a “religion of peace” ring so hollow, one
must closely examine the life of Mohammed himself, as taught to Muslims
through the Koran and Hadith. While Jesus sought to reach people through
love and compassion, individuals and tribes that refused to bow to Allah
and Mohammed paid and continue to pay a gruesome price. Mohammed was
first and foremost a war chief, and a close look at his life reveals
that his primary tool for the spread of Islam was violence. It is,
therefore, little wonder that violence continues to be such a defining
characteristic of Islamic societies today. Spencer also goes into why
Islam is no friend of Christians and Jews, despite efforts to paint
adherents the three faiths as servants of the same deity. Muslim groups
in the West are fond of quoting the handful of Koranic passages that
appear conciliatory toward Christians and Jews, while ignoring the far
larger number of passages that command Muslims to subjugate, expel and
destroy those who do not accept Allah and his messenger. There is a lot
more in the book than what I have touched on above, and every chapter is
meticulously researched. _The Truth About Mohammed_ is also a great
index of all those early Islamic texts that give the lie to present day
pronouncements about Islam that don&#8217;t seem to jibe with the actions of
Muslims around the world. This is a must-read for people in the West,
whose societies are being infiltrated and manipulated by Muslims in
obedience to Mohammed&#8217;s instruction to force the world into submission
to Allah. \

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The results of yet another Palestinian opinion poll show that a very
sizable portion of that public would still vote Hamas if elections were
held today. Many commentators and Western leaders say that means Hamas
is an inescapable reality and must be engaged, not isolated. They are
wrong. Conducted by the Jerusalem Media Communications Center, the poll
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/896435.html">showed</a> that if
leadership elections were held today, current “president” Mahmoud Abbas
would receive 20.6 percent of the vote, while Hamas Prime Minister
Ismail Haniyeh would be chosen by 18.8 percent of the public. Clearly,
the year-long diplomatic and economic isolation of the Hamas government
has not convinced many Palestinians to reconsider their choice of
leaders. A lot of liberals, including the leaders of many European
countries, will point to that fact as evidence that, like it or not,
Hamas is part of the Palestinian landscape and must be accepted as such.
But the correct answer is not to accept Hamas and hope to moderate its
policies through pointless talks. Hamas became popular primarily because
of its successful execution of terrorist violence against Israel, and it
is not going to renounce the very tactic that brought it to power. The
correct answer is to reeducate the Palestinians. Following World War II,
there were a lot of Germans and Japanese who still sympathized and
agreed with the policies of the Nazis and the imperial regime in Tokyo.
The US and its allies did not throw up their hands and just accept that
fact. No, they implemented stringent reeducation programs that have
today resulted in Germany and Japan being two of the most unlikely
nations to start a war. As part of the “Oslo” peace accords, the
Palestinian Authority was supposed to reeducate the Arabs under its
jurisdiction in the same way. But that was where the Western powers that
oversaw the peace process departed from the wisdom of their predecessors
- they put responsibility for the reeducation in the hands of those who
needed to be reeducated. As a result, most Palestinians today see
violence against Israel as a legitimate negotiating tactic and will vote
for the group that can most successfully kill Jews and score perceived
military victories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know that a large bulk of US taxpayers&#8217; dollars sent to the
Palestinian Authority ultimately go to finance acts of terrorism against
Israelis. But the Palestinians say that even with the cash, in the
absence of US military training, they could have never killed so many
Israelis over the past seven years. A senior member of Palestinian
Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; Presidential Guard had this to say in a
recent <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/60989">interview with _The New York
Sun_</a>: > I do not think that the
operations of the Palestinian resistance would have been so successful
and would have killed more than one thousand Israelis since
2000&#8230;without these [American] trainings.” The official noted that the
high Israeli body count had directly contributed to Israel&#8217;s decision to
flee the Gaza Strip in 2005, marking a clear victory for
American-enabled Palestinian terrorism. Not only does this show that far
from combatting global Islamic terrorism, the US is actually
facilitating it in some parts of the world, it also debunks the myth
that the Palestinians see their seven-year-old terrorist uprising as a
catastrophic disaster. How could they see it as such when they are now
closer than ever to receiving a sovereign state on pretty much every
inch of land they are currently demanding? No, the terrorist offensive
has worked, and, as the Palestinian official quoted above noted, it owes
its success to America. Oh, and in case some were confused, US training
has aided Palestinian terrorism because the majority of Palestinian
Authority security officers are also members of Palestinian terrorist
organizations. They take their US-supplied weapons and training and turn
around and kill Jews with them. But has Washington taken any of this to
heart? Absolutely not. Just this month, the US State Department signed a
deal to provide even more advanced training to Abbas&#8217; forces out of fear
of a Hamas takeover in Judea and Samaria (the so-called “West Bank”). Of
course, Hamas already proved that its Iranian training trumps the
American training provided to Abbas&#8217; forces when it conquered the Gaza
Strip last June despite being vastly outnumbered. So one of two things
will now happen in Judea and Samaria: 1. Hamas will defeat Abbas&#8217; forces
despite their new training and weapons and will become a mini-Iran in
Israel&#8217;s own backyard; or 2. Abbas&#8217; forces will manage to retain control
in Judea and Samaria, and will be equipped to kill another thousand Jews
the moment their leadership gives the green light. Either way, bad news
for Israel, and shame on America.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While child sacrifice is not exactly condoned in Islam per se,
Palestinian Muslim terrorists regularly send young, impressionable
children to their deaths in service to Allah&#8217;s cause of eradicating the
Jewish cancer from the Middle East. The latest example of this
despicable practice occurred on Tuesday, when two Palestinian children,
aged 10 and 12, <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=13832">were killed and a third was seriously
wounded</a>
by Israeli forces firing on what they thought was a terrorist rocket
crew. Why did Israel think the children were a terrorist rocket crew?
Because the real terrorists did a good job of convincing them. The group
of children came under fire as they approached a rocket launcher that
had just recently been used to attack a nearby town in southern Israel.
Unable to tell if the approaching figures were unarmed, curious
civilians or armed terrorists preparing another attack, the Israelis
opened fire in self defense. An Israeli army statement later noted that
Palestinian terrorists regularly send children to retrieve weapons in
the field hoping that they will be killed and in their deaths provide an
opportunity to further demonize the Jewish state. This is the absolute
height of cowardice. But why are the children themselves willing to be
put in such danger? I don&#8217;t know about you, but I wouldn&#8217;t go anywhere
near a rocket launcher that had just been used to attack a militarily
superior enemy, and I will teach my own children to behave in kind.
Remember, these are young children, and they don&#8217;t know any better than
what their own parents, elders, leaders and role models tell them. And
the Palestinians have very successfully created a culture of running
toward danger, a culture that <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/07/17/indoctrination-of-death">glorifies death
itself</a>. As
Bible believers, we are taught to defend the weak and the helpless.
Secular humanists twist this concept by trying to defend Palestinian
children against Israeli defensive measures, when in fact they need to
be protected from their own society.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Evangelical Christian community in Israel is abuzz this week after
learning that a well liked and widely respected Christian couple who
have been living in the Land for 20 years have been <a href="http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/214837.aspx">told to
leave</a>. Ron and Carol Cantrell
spent years working at the Christian humanitarian outreach <a href="http://www.bridgesforpeace.org/">Bridges for
Peace</a> and operated their own ministry,
<a href="http://www.shalom-shalom-jerusalem.org/">Shalom Shalom Jerusalem</a>, with
the aim of educating the Christian world regarding Israel&#8217;s central
importance in God&#8217;s plan of global redemption. Two of the Cantrell
children are today married to Israelis and will be remaining here, which
explains Ron and Carol&#8217;s decision to not fight the Ministry of Interior
ruling and possibly be blacklisted from ever entering the country even
to visit future grandchildren. The news was most troubling to many of us
Christian Zionists here in Israel because the Cantrells had given up a
far more comfortable life in America in order to serve the Lord in
Israel and defend the Jewish state, and that at a time when a record
number of Israelis are themselves trying to move to the US. Not only
that, Ron was actually in a suicide bomb attack in 2003 in downtown
Jerusalem. He was unhurt outside of a few scratches, but was a direct
witness to the gruesome slaughter of 17 people and the maiming of
another 70. Despite experiencing the dire security situation first hand,
Ron and Carol&#8217;s determination to remain planted in Israel only grew
stronger. These are the very kind of people Isaiah (14:1) speaks of: >
The Lord will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel
and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite
with the house of Jacob. And that is why I believe they are being
targeted, and why others will also be forced to leave, barring the
Lord&#8217;s intervention. It is easy to criticize the Israeli government for
kicking out sincere people dedicated to this nation at a time when many
Israelis themselves just want to leave, and that criticism is justified.
However, there is a spiritual element here. It is telling that die-hard
Christian Zionists who are recognized by many Israelis as the only truly
dedicated allies they have in the world are being targeted for
deportation, when groups such as the Scientologists and other New Age
movements are <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3437443,00.html">actively brainwashing Israeli
children</a>
with messages that run absolutely contrary to God&#8217;s Word and Judaism.
The enemy wants the allies God Himself has provided for Israel out,
while groups teaching alternative “truths” are allowed to prosper. The
true enemy here is _the_ Enemy, not the Israeli authorities. Pray that
the Israelis will begin to have their eyes opened to this deception
sooner rather than later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#8217;s office confirmed this week that he is
willing to offer the Palestinians joint control over the Temple Mount as
part of a final status peace agreement. Doesn&#8217;t Israel first need to
actually have control over the Temple Mount in order to make such an
offer? Naturally, the Palestinians have responded to Olmert&#8217;s offer
(which will be loudly opposed within Israel) by demanding even more.
It&#8217;s full sovereignty over the Temple Mount or nothing, insisted a
Palestinian official who <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57195">spoke to
WorldNetDaily</a>:
> There can be no agreement with Israel unless we get complete
sovereignty of the Mount. Once Palestinian control over the [Temple
Mount] is fixed, then we will make assurances for Jewish visits to the
site. Yeah, right. We won&#8217;t hold our breath on the whole “allowing Jews
to visit” deal. What gets me is that this story gives the impression
that today Israel actually has control over the Temple Mount, that Jews
are freely visiting Judaism&#8217;s most holy site, and would like to continue
to do so even after peace with the Palestinians. The reality is that the
Palestinians already control the Temple Mount. Sure, Israel is in
control all around the holy plateau, but up top, the Muslims run the
show and are accountable to no one. There are laws in place, and on
paper is appears that Israel has sovereignty over the Temple Mount, but
that hasn&#8217;t stopped the Islamic authorities there from conducting
massive excavations and building new mosques at the expense of millennia
of Jewish history and in violation of those laws. Furthermore, the
Muslims have decided, against Israeli law, that the Temple Mount is the
only place in Israel where freedom of religion is denied. Jews and
Christians are forbidden to pray atop the Temple Mount or to carry
Bibles there, and that is when they are allowed up at all. This has been
decided by the Muslims, and they have even managed to get the Israeli
police to enforce their dictates. So tell me, who is in charge on the
Temple Mount? The only thing missing is the Palestinian flag.</p>

takes place, it would mark the first time a full-fledge terrorist
organization had become a government in charge of a territorial entity.
What the writer of the analysis overlooked was the fact that Yasser
Arafat&#8217;s PLO already accomplished that feat more than a decade ago. It&#8217;s
been less than 15 years since the Olso peace process began, and already
everyone (even Israelis) has been fully conditioned to view the PLO as
the legitimate, if not rough-around-the-edges, political and diplomatic
representative of a large population of people. What is for some reason
forgotten by most people today is that the PLO attained that position by
first becoming the world&#8217;s premier terrorist killing machine. And it was
not only Jews who fell prey. More than a few non-Jews around the globe,
including <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/canoel.htm">American
diplomats</a>, were taken down
by the PLO as well. Just 20 years ago, Yasser Arafat was Osama bin
Laden, and the PLO was Al Qaeda. In fact, the PLO was so much more than
Al Qaeda. While bin Laden&#8217;s group is large, it pretty much works alone,
except for that alliance with Taliban. But the PLO in its heyday was
_the_ place to go if you wanted to hone your terrorist skills. PLO
bases in Lebanon <a href="http://www.geocities.com/capitolHill/Parliament/2587/terror.html">are credited with
training</a>
a whole range of other terror groups, from Ireland&#8217;s IRA to Japan&#8217;s Red
Army. * The original report from the Israeli news site can be found

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That is the kind of headline I expect to see on all those anti-Semitic
websites hiding behind the mask of being critical of Israel when they
read the news that Israeli scientists have discovered how to erase
long-term memory. It just fits so well with all those “the Jews are
trying to secretly rule the world” conspiracies. Anyway, while those nut
jobs are howling about how the Jews are coming to suck out their brains,
they will have missed yet another astonishing medical breakthrough by
God&#8217;s Chosen. In recent tests, researchers at Israel&#8217;s Weizmann
Institute of Science <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3438816,00.html">managed to isolate long-term
memories</a> in
the brains of rats and then used an enzyme inhibitor to block the
protein that moves information related to those memories. The rats
immediately forgot about a particular food the researchers had trained
them to recognize as making them sick. It is just the first step on a
long road to developing treatments for humans suffering from dementia,
defective memory or a whole range of other memory-related ailments. But
it is an impressive step. The disproportionate number of technological
and medical advances that have come out of Israel is amazing. Despite
Israel&#8217;s flaws and many mistakes, Paul says that God has blessed them
for their fathers&#8217; sakes (Romans 11:28), and we can certainly see the
evidence of that.</p>
