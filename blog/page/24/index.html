  <div class="entry-content"><p>Driving around in Southern California today I noticed a bumper sticker
that read &#8220;War is not the answer.&#8221; I assume it was a liberal jab at
President George W. Bush&#8217;s going to war against those who attacked this
nation a short five years ago. It got me thinking about the kind of
ignorant &#8220;happy-in-the-bubble&#8221; mindset that would lead to the proud
display of such a statement. War is not the answer to what exactly? Is
war not the answer to a massive attack that took the lives of some 3,000
of your countrymen? Because I guarantee, endless talking and &#8220;diplomacy&#8221;
would only leave the door open for more such assaults. Clinton eschewed
the path of war after Al Qaeda and its allies bombing a number of US
embassies and other American targets during his presidency. That
decision left bin Laden and his cronies virtually unbothered to plot
their next massacre of infidels. Clearly, Clinton&#8217;s path &#8220;was not the
answer.&#8221; So if Clinton-esque diplomacy won&#8217;t work, and Bush&#8217;s blazzing
guns are unacceptable, pray tell, how is America to deal with the
Islamic threat against it and the rest of the West that has been gaining
in intensity for decades now? I hear a lot of complaining by Bush&#8217;s
detractors, but very few suggested alternatives. I guess the problem is
that so many Americans refuse to accept this one fundamental truth: You
would still be at war even if Bush had not liberated Afghanistan and
Iraq. The only choice to make here is whether you want to sit back
absorbing attacks, or take the fight to your enemies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the wake of World War II, the United States occupied and controlled
many aspects of life in Japan. Today that nation is one of the world&#8217;s
most peaceful and prosperous. A similar phenomenon is taking place in
Iraq, though not to quite so drastic a degree. (Perhaps that&#8217;s because
the occupation is not as full-fledged as in post-WWII Japan?) If
comments made by Iraqi readers on a BBC forum (BBC no less!) discussing
the abduction of IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit are anything to go by, the
citizens of Iraq are beginning - as a direct result of America&#8217;s
intervention - to reject terrorism so thoroughly as to actually support
Israel&#8217;s current action against Hamas. From Iraq the Model, whose author
was kind enough to <a href="http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com/2006/07/singing-out-of-flock.html">monitor the Arabic-language BBC
site</a>
and translate some of the more pertinent comments: > &#8220;About three
dozens of comments were made by Iraqis both inside Iraq and in exile and
all these comments were supportive of Israel or at least against Hamas
as far as the topic is concerned except for only three comments; that&#8217;s
a 10:1 ratio while as you probably have guesses, the opposite ratio is
true about the comments by the rest of Arabs.&#8221; > > &#8230; > > &#8220;&#8230;what
really makes me feel optimistic about this new Iraqi way of thinking is
that it shows how Iraqis are beginning to distinguish between terrorism
and rightful acts of resistance not only in Iraq but also on a global
level and are showing decreasing tolerance for extremism and this in my
opinion is what builds peace in the region or any given region of this
world.&#8221;</p>

Palestinians. You know, like that they stop firing rockets at Israeli

demanded that Israel take urgent action to prevent a humanitarian

accomplished lately besides condemning and strong-arming Israel into

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has rejected Western demands that he
respond to a new proposal regarding the cessation of Iran&#8217;s nuclear
efforts by the middle of this month.
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/07/06/uputin.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/07/06/ixnews.html">To</a>

<a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/762247">consternation</a> of officials
in Europe and Washington, Ahmadinejad promised only to respond by the
end of the Iranian month of Mordad (August 22). Why that date? Why so
long to look over a simple package of incentives and give either a
negative or a positive reply? Finding the answers to these troubling
questions may require America and Europe to come to terms with a reality
Western liberalism has done its best to ignore - that Islam remains
engaged in a clash of civilizations with the Judeo-Christian world. You
see, Ahmadinejad is a <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1525328/posts">strong
believer</a> in the
Shi&#8217;ite tradition of a 12th imam, the so-called &#8220;hidden&#8221; Imam Mahdi who
Allah has miraculously kept alive since his disappearance in 874 AD. As
the story goes, Imam Mahdi will return at a time of great global chaos,
oppression and bloodshed and usher in an era of (Islamic) justice.
Ahmadinejad sees himself as Allah&#8217;s instrument to pave the way for Imam
Mahdi, and constantly uses public appearances to urge his countrymen to
prepare to back him in this task. Rumor is, Imam Mahdi could be
returning this August (or shortly thereafter), just around the time some
military experts believe Iran will be <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=28238">ready to
construct</a> its first nuclear
weapon. Go figure. Ahmadinejad has made clear his confidence that he and
other true believers can affect this apocalyptic timetable, and will
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/902">use all means</a> at his disposal to
do so. Also of note is that August 22 of this year corresponds with the
Islamic date of Rajab 28, the day Saladin conquered and entered
Jerusalem. Taken in conjunction with Ahmadinejad&#8217;s stated desire to see
Israel destroyed, it hardly seems a coincidence. Will the coming months
see Ahmadinejad attempt to bring about Imam Mahdi&#8217;s return by attacking
Israel and generating the necessary regional and global chaos? Perhaps
the better question is, will the West start to take this man at his word
in time to stop him?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For more than a decade Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority
flaunted the terms of the &#8220;Oslo&#8221; peace agreements by refusing to combat
and end anti-Jewish &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror. Now the failure of the
Western-brokered land-for-peace process has reached all new lows. Hamas,
one of the terror groups the peace process should have made obsolete and
put out of business, is today in control of the PA and has
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/946">ordered</a> its Western-trained
Israeli-armed &#8220;policemen&#8221; to fight the Israelis and protect the
terrorists. How far must this go before those in power admit this whole
formula was a mistake and realize that a new course of action is needed?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>International pressure is beginning to mount, the mainstream media is
turning nasty, and even the Bush Administration is starting to waver in
its support as Operation Summer Rains enters its second week. But there
is also every indication that Israel&#8217;s refusal to negotiate and give in
to terrorist blackmail is working. On Monday Hamas and its allies issued
an ultimatum demanding Israel free 1,000 jailed terrorists in less than
24 hours or &#8220;suffer the consequences&#8221;, presumably in the blood of
abducted IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit. On Wednesday they signalled the
ultimatum had been a bluff when fresh, toned-down demands were issued.
Reuters, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3271799,00.html">quoting an unnamed government
source</a>,
reported Israel was prepared to partially meet those new terms. One can
only hope that report is nothing more than international wishful
thinking that Israel is again folding when it should be holding fast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>United Nations officials in the Gaza Strip are
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3271711,00.html">complaining</a>
that Arab children living there are wetting their beds due to the tense
and frightening situation created by Israel&#8217;s current military
operations. As if Israel&#8217;s decisions and actions are taken in a vacuum,
in the total absence of influence by outside factors. There is a very
simple solution to this problem: Tell the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to stop firing
rockets at Israeli towns. As soon as that happens, it is a certainty
that Israel will stop striking targets in Gaza. Of course, the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; don&#8217;t want everyone to know that about Israel, so they
will continue firing rockets, assured that the UN and other &#8220;human
rights&#8221; groups will play right into their hands by ignoring the Arab
provocation and condemning the Israeli response. By the way, when was
the last time Damien Personnaz and his UNICEF teams visited and assisted
the traumatized children of Sderot?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is sometimes mind-boggling to watch Israel play down the threat of
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorism. Especially when doing so is so very detrimental
to both the nation&#8217;s security and its efforts to win the media war, and
by extension the sympathy of the international community. The latest
sample of this irrational behavior came to light as a result of two
Kassam rocket attacks on the coastal city of Ashkelon over the past 24
hours. Ashkelon City Council member Amram Ben David <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3271781,00.html">made this
concerning
revelation</a>
in an interview with Ynet: > &#8220;Before the elections then-Defense
Minister Shaul Mofaz came and convinced us not to make a big deal after
the Kassams hit southern Ashkelon, because it could harm the city’s
progress.&#8221; What are these people to think when their own defense
minister says such things? By contrast, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; turn every
Israeli bullet that finds a target (whether intentional or otherwise)
into an international media event. In fact, they even manage to turn
self-inflicted casualties into international Israel-bashing events.
Israel needs to be shoving every Kassam rocket, every mortar shell and
every &#8220;suicide&#8221; bomb belt down the throats of the UN, US, Europe and the
international media. Israel needs to be responding with, as the world
puts it, hugely &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; force to all acts of aggression by
the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; if for nothing else than to make sure everyone knows
they are occuring. Because if Israel, which is so enamored with what
everyone else thinks of it, will not fully highlight the threat to its
own people, I guarantee the international media and Western governments
are not going to pick up the slack.</p>
