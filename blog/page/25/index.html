  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Russian political commentator
<a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=29921">argues</a> that modern day
political correctness is ineffective when it comes to resolving the
Israeli-Arab conflict, and that the two sides should be left to fight it
out. > &#8220;According to political correctness, bad negotiations are better
than a good war. This humane postulate seems beyond question, and
therefore all peace initiatives of intermediaries in the Middle East are
praised even if they are practically useless. &#8230;Political reality is
not, and is unlikely to ever become, politically correct.&#8221; The author,
Pyotr Romanov, suggests what he admits is today viewed as a &#8220;heretical
solution&#8221;: > &#8220;Let the two sides fight it out.&#8221; Romanov goes on to extol
the political clarity of the British more than a century ago in
realizing there was little that could realistically be done
diplomatically to end fighting between the Ottoman Empire and rebel
forces in the Balkans, and urging the more emotional Russians to just
let the two sides fight it out. > &#8220;&#8230;the British, who did not know the
term &#8216;political correctness&#8217; then, regarded the problem from the
viewpoint of common sense and reason.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Palestinian Authority - that &#8220;moderate&#8221; bunch headed by Mahmoud
Abbas - has <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/012063.php">resumed
broadcasts</a> on its
official television station of a horrendous clip urging young Arab
children to seek death while engaging in acts of violence against
Israel&#8217;s Jews. When this clip was first aired in 2003, it resulted in
some 70-80 percent of Palestinian Arab children expressing a desire to
become &#8220;martyrs&#8221; for Allah, according to a public opinion poll. And
Israel is blamed for creating a humanitarian crisis?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As much as I hope and pray that Corporal Gilad Shalit is returned safe
and whole to his family, I have a growing fear that he is not going to
survive this ordeal. And if the Allah-possessed &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; beasts who
took Shalit do in fact harm or execute him, Israel - both the people and
the military - is likely to react with fury. It is important to note
now, before that happens, that the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have a choice. Whether
or not the coming storm and all the new hardships associated with it
slams into Gaza is entirely up to them. Let Shalit go and the Israeli
soldiers will all go away. Stop firing Kassam rockets and the Israeli
jets, helicopters and artillery will all go away. My guess: The
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; will stick to their current policies, because new
hardships mean new propaganda opportunities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And the hypocrisy continues. Physicians for Human Rights has issued a
<a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=29913">wordy statement</a> condemning
Israel&#8217;s &#8220;collective punishment&#8221; of Gaza&#8217;s Arab population for the
numerous terrorist attacks emanating from that area. Shame this
supposedly unbiased and objective organization fails to issue similar
statements when the Palestinian Arabs collectively punish Israel by
purposely targeting any Jewish men, women and children they can get
their hands on, forcing the entire Israeli population to live with a
constant degree of fear. The statement goes on to insist that if Israel
is going to take military action, it has an obligation to separate
combatants from the civilian population, and avoid harming the latter.
No word, however, on the fact the terrorist combatants are purposely and
illegally using the civilian population as cover. For all their whining
about Israel&#8217;s methods, you would think Physicians for Human Rights
would at least occassionally throw out some alternative ideas for
protecting Israelis while safeguarding the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; population to
their satisfaction. But, I guess Jewish blood is cheap.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite being under siege from Islamic terrorism in a way no other
nation on earth has to deal with, Israel still finds time for the little
things - you know, like <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2006/07/israel_discover.html">finding cures for
cancer</a>.
Makes one wonder about the kinds of accomplishments this nation would be
capable of if Mohammed&#8217;s hordes were not bearing down on it. And while
this miniscule nation with no natural resources to speak of aside from
its people continues to churn out medical and technological advances,
what of the large oil-rich Muslim nations that surround it? Seems their
only true talent remains the spread of chaos and bloodshed. One society
focused on life, the other on death and destruction. And the world has
the gall to suggest Israel is the impediment to peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember last year when the &#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; Israeli leftists and the
international community were all aflutter over what the Gaza Strip would
become without those terrible Jewish settlers who had caused the barren
coastal strip to bloom and provided jobs for perhaps thousands of Arabs?
Things didn&#8217;t go according to plan, apparently. > Gaza is a &#8220;bottomless
pit of violence and chaos,&#8221; Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz (a
poster child for the Israeli Left) told a Friends of the IDF convention
in Tel Aviv Sunday. Few would dispute that claim. Naturally, Israel, and
not the Palestinians&#8217; inability to build a peaceful and prosperous
society on their own, is to blame for this mess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the international community makes its expected shift from initially
supporting Israel&#8217;s right to a military response to last week&#8217;s
abductions and rocket attacks to shrieking in dismay that said response
is causing a &#8220;humanitarian crisis,&#8221; Prime Minister Ehud Olmert <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270166,00.html">insists
on a little
perspective</a>.
Rightly does Olmert point out that the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are shooting to
kill any Jewish man, women or child they can manage to hit. Israel is
simply making life temporarily uncomfortable for the terrorist hordes
and the population that harbors and to large degree supports them (as
evidenced by Hamas&#8217; sweeping electoral victories).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/733789.html">According to
Ha&#8217;aretz</a>, Israel is
now seriously considering the release of an untold number of
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; security prisoners in return for the release of IDF
Corporal Gilad Shalit. This after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3267682,00.html">originally
vowed</a> no
negotiation with the Hamas terrorists who carried out the abduction or
with their overlords in the Palestinian Authority, and no &#8220;prisoner
exchange.&#8221; On the surface it doesn&#8217;t look so unreasonable. The report
says Israel is only considering the release of those Hamas officials it
rounded up over the past several days and a handful of other prisoners
without &#8220;blood on their hands.&#8221; In other words, no one who has managed
to kill a Jew yet will be set free. But mark my words, before this is
over it will turn into a discussion on the release of any and every type
of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; prisoner, because to everyone but Israel they are just
freedom fighters, prisoners of war if you will. And it is legitimate to
trade prisoners of war for other prisoners of war. This is of course
ignoring the fact that a worrying number of prisoners without &#8220;blood on
their hands&#8221; that Israel released as part of other agreements over the
past few years turned around and immediately participated in deadly
terrorist attacks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Ghanaian soccer player celebrated his team&#8217;s upset 2-0 victory over
the Czech Republic Saturday by waving a small Israeli flag (he plays
professionally for an Israeli soccer team). Israel&#8217;s supposedly friendly
neighbors in Egypt, who had previously been rooting for their fellow
Africans, responded with anger. The _Al-Masry al-Yom_ newspaper
carried the following bold red headline on its frontpage Monday: >
&#8220;Egyptians supported the Ghanaian team all the way until the 82nd
minute, and regretted it after the Israeli flag (waving)&#8221; The
accompanying article started thus: > &#8220;As soon as the referee blew his
whistle to start the match, Egyptians were out enthusiastically, almost
hysterically supporting Ghana, until defender John Paintsil took out the
Israeli flag.&#8221; Some papers predictably accused Paintsil of being a
Mossad agent, while popular sports commentator Alaa Sadek wrote in the
_Al-Akhbar_ that Paintsil was simply &#8220;ignorant and stupid.&#8221; Some
friends.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite evidence that Israel could not possibly have been responsible
for the deaths of seven &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; family members on a Gaza beach
last week, the Jewish state&#8217;s self-proclaimed leftist &#8220;elites&#8221; continue
to condemn both themselves and their nation. The lastest to join in this
act of self-flagellation is popular TV talk show host Yair Lapid, who
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3264384,00.html">wrote</a> in an
editorial published by _Yediot Ahronot_ that he is &#8220;ashamed. Deeply,
painfully humiliated, ashamed of us and what we have done, where we have
ended up. &#8230;because we have become child killers.&#8221; The only &#8220;proof&#8221;
that Israel was responsible for those deaths are the unsubstantiated
claims of the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; themselves. And their word has not often
proved to be of any value. You know, Yair, in addition to being &#8220;child
killers,&#8221; the Arabs also insist you Jews are the sons of monkeys and
pigs. Do their assertions also make that true?</p>
