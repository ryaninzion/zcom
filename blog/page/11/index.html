  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will come as no surprise, but the government of Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert still very much intends to uproot thousands of Jews from Judea
and Samaria in the very near future. Vice Premier Shimon Peres said on
Israeli television on Saturday that by the end of the current
government&#8217;s term, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894561996&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">at least several dozen established Jewish towns in
Judea and Samaria will be no
more</a>.
It is still staggering to watch Israel talk openly of surrender in the
name of peace, even after all the evidence that the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have
presented proving that they do not really want peaceful coexistence. You
can chalk this one up to a combination of internal Israeli foolishness
and massive self-serving pressure from Washington. I personally don&#8217;t
think this plan will ever be implemented, but I said the same thing
before the abhorrent uprooting of Jewish Gaza, so I could be wrong. That
means that despite our firm belief that in the end God is going to have
His way and Israel will come out on top, if we don&#8217;t want to see
thousands more Bible-believing Jewish brothers and sisters violently
ripped from their God-given inheritance along the way, then we need to
do something now. More comments on this issue from <a href="http://israelmatzav.blogspot.com/2007/03/peres-olmert-still-wants-to-dismantle.html">Carl at israel

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Extreme Israeli leftist peace activists demanded on Saturday that the
government demolish the grave of a Jewish resident of Hebron who gunned
down 29 &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; at the cave where Israel&#8217;s patriarchs are buried
in 1994. The call came after <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1171894563799">scuffles broke
out</a>
between a group of fellow Hebron residents who had gathered in memory of
the killer and police officers who were on hand to arrest anyone that
displayed support for individuals or groups deemed to be &#8220;Jewish
terrorists.&#8221; Now, without getting into a debate over the actions of
Baruch Goldstein, I want to point out the glaring contrasts between
Israeli and &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; societies and their reaction to those in their
midsts who take the lives of unarmed civilians on the other side. When a
few Jews gathered at the weekend to remember Goldstein, Israeli police
showed up in force to make sure no one even whispered support for what
he did. When a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; is killed in the process of murdering
Israeli Jews, the residents of his town hold a massive street parade en
route to his funeral that is usually sanctioned and protected by the
Palestinian Authority police. The event is typically characterized by
chants of support for the slaughter of Jews. No one is arrested for
making such virulent calls. Furthermore, despite the fact that
Saturday&#8217;s memorial ceremony was so small and insignificant, it was
distasteful enough for Israel&#8217;s &#8220;Peace Now&#8221; to loudly issue a pubic
appeal for the destruction of Goldstein&#8217;s grave. Now I am wondering, if
the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are truly as interested in peace as the Israelis,
where are the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; peace activists demanding not only that
their own militants cease their violent actions, but insisting on harsh
official treatment of those who celebrate the murder of Israeli Jews? It
is time that we demand the world see this contrast: In one society,
those deemed terrorists are vigorously persecuted, while in the other,
murderers of men, women and children are gloriously celebrated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel on Wednesday went one step further in making good on its promise
to, yet again, sacrifice its own security for the sake of Arab &#8220;dignity&#8221;
by easing airport security checks on the one group of people capable of
mass-murdering airline passengers: Arab Muslims. In response to the
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894542812&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">nagging of Israeli Arab
lawmakers</a>
over the &#8220;degradation&#8221; of Arab passengers at Israel&#8217;s airports, the head
of the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) promised to spend huge amounts
of money to install new technology and ensure that all passengers are
checked the same. But if the Arabs really want these kinds of
&#8220;humiliating&#8221; checks to stop, maybe they should focus on getting the
more violent elements of their society to shape up. You see, the real
problem is that most of the Arabs (**and I say this knowing that there
are many <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/256">truly good, loyal Israeli
Arabs</a>**) don&#8217;t see the fact
that some of their number engage in anti-Israel violence as a problem.
In fact, they celebrate violence against Israel by their own and by
neighboring Arab entities. (Read more about Israeli Arab <a href="http://www.pmw.org.il/bulletins_Aug2006.htm#b100806">support for
Hezbollah rocket attacks on
Israel</a> last
summer.) And still they have the audacity to demand that Israel change
its ways, that Israel bend over backwards and put itself at risk to make
them feel like equal citizens when they applaud the enemies of the
state? This whole whining and moaning bit seems to work really well for
the Arabs, not only here in Israel, but also in America and Europe.
Maybe its time that we non-Arabs start to whine and moan every time the
Arabs do something we don&#8217;t like and demand they change their behavior
and rein in their bad apples. And before anyone lays into me about how I
can&#8217;t possibly know what these poor Arab victims are going through, I
want to note that years ago, before I was married and had a family of my
own, I was regularly targeted as a single male passenger for extra
security checks at Israel&#8217;s international airport. While one time I did
get rather annoyed at having missed my flight, I would hardly describe
the experience as &#8220;humiliating,&#8221; nor would I demand the Israelis put
their lives at greater risk for the sake of my own pride.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michael Williams, special advisor on the Middle East to the new UN
chief, assured the world on Tuesday that during his recent visit to
Jerusalem he <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070227/wl_mideast_afp/mideastconflictlebanon">&#8220;forcefully&#8221; let
Israel</a>
know that its violations of Lebanese airspace are unacceptable. But I
wonder if the UN has employed equal force in insisting that Lebanon
comply with its obligations under the truce deal that ended last
summer&#8217;s war between Israel and Hezbollah? Of course, I know the answer
to that one. Apparently, these nitwits are more concerned about
Lebanon&#8217;s sovereignty over the air than they are about another war
erupting because still-heavily-armed Hezbollah can&#8217;t keep its missiles
in its pants.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli police recently apprehended a gang of six Israeli Arabs that
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894534328&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">brutally raped at least four Jewish girls in northern Israel over the
past two
years</a>
in solidarity with their &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; brethren. A suiting display of
homage to and support for such a violent society, I suppose. Tellingly,
this story is nowhere to be found in the mainstream international media.
In fact, as of Wednesday afternoon Israel time, The Jerusalem Post is
the only mainstream Israeli news source carrying it! I want to rephrase
a question I asked yesterday in regards to the bestial slaying of a
Jewish father near Hebron: What if a gang of six Israeli Jews had
brutally and systematically stalked and raped Muslim Arab girls over a
period of two years? I can guarantee that it would be front page news
around the globe, that Muslim religious leaders would be up in arms, and
that pundits would be ripping into Israel for failing to arrest and
punish the culprits sooner. But since the victims were only Jews, and
the perpetrators were Muslim Arabs who aren&#8217;t expected to behave any
better anyway, I guess it&#8217;s not much of a story. Did I mention that one
of the girls was only 13 when they raped her?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amir Peretz continues to remind everyone why he is totally the wrong man
for the job of defense minister of the State of Israel. The <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3370495,00.html">latest
example</a> of
Peretz&#8217;s total ineptness as top military defender of the Jewish state
came on Tuesday, when he said the IDF just may have to go back into Gaza
soon because: > &#8220;There is no reason to allow the recent escalation [in
rocket fire from Gaza] turn into a real threat to the State of Israel.&#8221;
I beg your pardon? The almost daily firing of missiles on your citizens
by those who propose to be your neighbors is not a threat to the
sovereignty and present and future security of the state? What other
nation on earth would allow its neighbors to daily lob missiles onto its
civilian population centers while pretending that such aggression does
not pose any &#8220;real threat&#8221; to its sovereignty and security? Don&#8217;t even
get me started on the unbelievable photos of Peretz inspecting military

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meryl Yourish already noted the <a href="http://www.yourish.com/2007/02/26/2791">diabolical cleverness of Hamas leader
Khaled Mashaal</a> when on Monday
he turned the tables on Israel by insisting that Jerusalem &#8220;recognize
the Palestinian state&#8217;s right to exist.&#8221; Mashaal remained on game today
when he very vaguely hinted that maybe, just maybe, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070227/wl_afp/russiadiplomacymideast">Hamas might think
about making peace with Israel at some undefined point in the
unforeseeable
future</a>.
Said Mashaal after meeting with his good friends in the Russian regime:
> &#8220;We have asked the international community to take rapid steps to
lift the embargo imposed on the Palestinian people [sic] &#8230; This will
create a political climate that could open a political prospect in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&#8221; Naturally, the mainstream media was quick
to push out stories about how Hamas was finally on the road to
&#8220;moderation.&#8221; Mashaal had shrewdly given the international community
just enough for those nations still focused on extracting &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
compliance with basic peace principles to get back to what they love
doing best - dissecting biblical Israel. Never mind that Mashaal
qualified his above remarks by stating that future &#8220;peace&#8221; must be based
on &#8220;Palestinian conditions,&#8221; which include such things as the &#8220;right&#8221; to
flood Israel with millions of so-called &#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; -
conditions that Israel and Mashaal alike know are meant to bring about
the demise of the Jewish state. That doesn&#8217;t matter to the main power
brokers behind the &#8220;peace&#8221; process, who keep pushing such issues off
until the point of final status talks, at which point Israel will be
strong-armed into accepting the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; conditions or risk being
accused of bogging down negotiations just as &#8220;peace&#8221; was in sight. All
that matters now is that Hamas said it wants peace! Right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now, anyone concerned enough about Israel to look beyond what the
mainstream international press is reporting knows that on Sunday, two
knife-wielding &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; teenagers ambushed and brutally murdered a
Jewish man while he was praying in a forest near his home in Judea. Can
anyone imagine what would happen if two Jewish settler teens stalked,
ambushed and hacked to death a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; Muslim on his prayer
carpet? Dave over at Israellycool <a href="http://www.israellycool.com/blog/_archives/2007/2/26/2766368.html">correctly
notes</a>
that, at the very least, the international press would have bothered to
report on the murder if the roles were reversed. But I dare-say the
international response and outrage would not stop there, not even close.
No, if Jews had committed such an act (if they were even capable of
committing such an act) the flood of newspaper articles, editorials and
scandalous television network reports would merely be the beginning.
From there we would have very outspoken condemnation by world leaders,
most likely leading one or another (or perhaps many) UN committees to
convene in special session to publicly blast the Israelis and their
mistreatment of the Palestinian Arabs. All of that, of course, would
result in renewed and intensified political pressure for Israel to more
hastily acquiesce to demands that it surrender additional land to the
&#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; And yet, the absolutely bestial slaying of an innocent
42-year-old father of three, <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2007/02/dhimmitube_take.html">who by all accounts was a most righteous
specimen of
humanity</a>,
is all but ignored because he was Jewish and a &#8220;settler.&#8221; As the Jews
say: &#8220;May the Almighty avenge his blood.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PeaNUT-job Jimmy Carter claims his <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3369679,00.html">truest and most heartfelt desire is
for Israel to live in
peace</a>, but
all he really cares about is getting the Israelis and Arabs to sign
another peace of worthless paper so he can cement his own legacy. Sadly,
Carter&#8217;s is the same path being tread by President George W. Bush, as it
was by Bill Clinton before him, and George Bush Sr. before him. Bush,
with his <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/268">messianic declarations about brining peace to the Middle
East</a> via his &#8220;two-state vision,&#8221;
certainly finds himself agreeing with Carter&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Israel
must exchange Palestinian land [sic] for peace.&#8221; That America&#8217;s leaders
failed to change their tune after Israel&#8217;s full surrender of the Gaza
Strip not only did not result in peace, but actually increased the
violence and led to Hamas&#8217; electoral victory should be proof enough that
their true goal is not peace, at least not for Israel. What concerns me
more, however, is the failure of Israel&#8217;s friends among the American
Christian community to unleash a hurricane of opposition to Bush&#8217;s plans
in the wake of this realization. I know people here and there are
writing to the White House, and there has been the occasional pro-Israel
rally (all of which I feel lacked real fire and passion.) But why don&#8217;t
Israel&#8217;s numerous friends in the US react to Bush&#8217;s policies regarding
the Holy Land in the same impassioned manner that the liberal Left
reacts to the war in Iraq? If Carter were still in office, I can imagine
a far greater mobilization of Christian opposition to his policies
vis-a-vis Israel. But Bush&#8217;s determined quest to play midwife to
&#8220;Palestine&#8221; is no less dangerous. In my view, it is Bush&#8217;s strong stand
against the America-hating Muslim &#8220;extremists&#8221; - which the president
wrongly identifies as a mere fringe element in the Islamic world - that
has kept the largely patriotic, America-loving Christian community from
focusing too much attention on his &#8220;Road Map to Israel&#8217;s demise.&#8221; I
don&#8217;t believe that Bush himself is evil, or has evil intentions. But
like so many Christians in America, I believe he is blinded to God&#8217;s
plans for Israel, and he is allowing his &#8220;war on terror&#8221; to be used by
the true, underlying Enemy to blunt what could be massive American
Christian support for and positive participation in that divine scheme.
I remember that just after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US an
American friend told my colleague <a href="http://www.stangoodenough.com/">Stan
Goodenough</a> that America&#8217;s Evangelicals
were still for Israel, but that we needed to back off on all the
pro-Israel stuff for a bit and let them deal with the assault on their
own nation. It is right to face down the demonic Islamofacist assault on
America, but not at the expense of remembering that Israel takes center
stage in God&#8217;s plans to defeat evil once and for all. If Americans are
allowing themselves to be made ineffective in the battle to prevent the
Enemy&#8217;s efforts to thwart God&#8217;s plans by dividing Israel, then their own
war on terror is ultimately pointless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I read the latest news reports sitting here at the mall in Jerusalem,
it suddenly hits me how close we are to a major regional war. And I am
not talking about a semi-isolated flare-up with Syria and/or Hezbollah.
I am talking about all-out war engulfing the entire region. Seems
strange to think that all the normalcy surrounding me now could very
soon be replaced by long nights in bomb shelters, air raid sirens,
curfews, standing in line to pick up updated gas masks and fresh
atropine - all the things that characterize life in an Israel at war.
Seems strange, although I do realize that it is going to happen, that it
has to happen. And if the reports I am reading are even partially true,
then we could be just months (even weeks?) away from that firestorm.
According to a Kuwaiti newspaper, three Gulf states - Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates - have already expressed their consent to the
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/830309.html">US and Israeli air forces entering their airspace to bomb
Iran</a>. NATO is pressing
Turkey to open its airspace and even land borders in preparation for a
possible assault on the Islamic Republic. And Israel itself is said to
be negotiating with Washington for an air corridor over Iraq in order to
hit Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has reportedly
drawn up plans for a <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3369248,00.html">major aerial assault on
Iran</a> that
can be implemented within 24 hours of receiving the order from President
Bush. Take all of that together with the fact that the US just recently
moved another carrier battle group into the Persian Gulf, and you can
see the stage clearly being set for war. Government officials from
Jerusalem to Brussels to Washington will all deny that war is imminent,
or that it is even being planned. But these are the same kinds of
reports we saw for weeks leading up to the time that American officials
would actually admit that we were about to go to war with Iraq.</p>
