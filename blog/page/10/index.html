  <div class="entry-content"><p>US strategy in Iraq is based on the mistaken assumption that Arab
Islamic culture is fertile ground for American-style democracy. But has
that form of democracy ever been successful in the Middle East? It
hasn&#8217;t worked in Egypt and Syria, nation&#8217;s that pretend to be democratic
and send their people to the polls, only to ensure that the reigning
dictator always receives at least 90% of the vote. It hasn&#8217;t worked in
Lebanon, where terror bosses fill many of the parliament&#8217;s seats and
even ministerial positions, and order their own forces to violently
oppose government policy when it does not mesh with their own. The same
can be said of the Palestinian Authority, which last year did hold
actual democratic elections. The Palestinian Arabs were given an
opportunity to democratically elect their representatives, and they
overwhelmingly voted for the most blood-soaked terrorists among them.
The only &#8220;good&#8221; example of democracy in the Middle East is Jordan, and
it only works there because ultimately a monarch holds the reins of
power. So why believe that a fractious Iraq will be any different? Why
will that nation suddenly be the one Islamic state that will become a
mirror of American and European democracy? The answer is that it won&#8217;t.
Looking at Iraq, we need to consider why there is more bloodshed and
insurgency today when democracy and political freedom are being given a
chance than there was during the authoritarian rule of Saddam Hussein.
What needs to be remembered is that Arab Islamic culture is based on a
tribal system that still very much influences daily life in the region.
In that tribal system, perception is everything, and whoever is
perceived as being the strongest will be accepted as leader, even if
they are hated. Furthermore, Islam itself encompasses both personal
faith and political governance. It dictates how a majority-Muslim nation
is to be run. In the case of Iraq, Saddam Hussein faced less insurgency
and rebellion than today&#8217;s democratic government because he was
recognized as the dominant, if not stabilizing, power within the
country. The same is true when comparing Syria and Jordan to Lebanon.
Syria and Jordan have experienced relatively few uprisings because the
regimes are powerful and have demonstrated their willingness to use
excessive force to put down any threat to their rule. Lebanon, however,
has suffered decades of sectarian violence at least in part because
efforts to maintain a Western-style democracy has created a central
government that is both less powerful and less willing to use excessive
force than the various other armed forces that roam the country. The
Palestinian Authority is now experiencing a similar fate because of the
decision to let the people vote for who they perceived to be the
strongest, and therefore the best leaders. Over the past decade, Hamas
has managed to create a perception of itself as powerful enough to do
damage to the Palestinian Arabs&#8217; greatest enemy - Israel. The group was
and is viewed as the strongest among that society because of its
unrepentant willingness to employ brutal violence against both external
and internal enemies, unlike the PLO which, at least on the surface,
pretends to follow a more Western-style of diplomacy and dialogue. The
fact of the matter is that Arab Islamic culture is not fertile ground
for American-style democracy. As I see it, America has two choices in
Iraq: 1. Drop the idea of American-style democracy and instead implement
a form a representative government that works in tandem and is at least
partially subordinate to a strong central leadership that wields
ultimate military power. This solution would probably require dividing
Iraq along its more natural ethnic lines. 2. Realize that the only way
to turn an authoritarian society into a truly democratic one is to
implement a far more heavy-handed and drawn out occupation with the aim
of completely reeducating the population. This is precisely how Japan
was transformed, over a period of many years, from a society that would
sacrifice everything to expand the domains of its god-like emperor to
one that now fully embraces the ideals of American democracy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an address to academics in Jerusalem on Monday, US Ambassador to
Israel Richard Jones indicated that despite their nearly identical
behavior in regards to anti-Israel terrorism, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/837246.html">Washington accepts the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; but rejects
Syria</a>. Because of its
continued support for and cooperation with terrorist organizations such
as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) and Hezbollah, the US cannot view Syria as a true
partner in the diplomatic peace process, said Jones. Jones said that in
light of this behavior, Washington must conclude that recent Syrian
peace overtures were made simply to gain international legitimacy, and
not in the spirit of true peace. Meanwhile, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; not only
support and harbor Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the PFLP, but they
overwhelmingly voted for Hamas to lead them! The US will insist that it
is only cooperating with Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah, but remember that
Fatah&#8217;s &#8220;armed wings&#8221; - the Tanzim and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades - are
also recognized by the US as terrorist organizations. Not only has Abbas
done nothing to shut down those groups, but he in fact employs a large
portion of their members as Palestinian Authority police officers. And,
of course, Abbas is now in a ruling partnership with Hamas. He is
directly cooperating with and harboring within the territories
ostensibly under his control the very group whose presence in Damascus
is a primary obstacle to talks with Syria. This is duplicitousness. This
is hypocrisy. Either supporting, harboring and cooperating with
terrorists is an obstacle to peace, or it is not. You cannot alter the
criteria just because you are more eager to get a piece of paper signed
with one entity than with the other. Israel lives will be lost because
of this treacherous position. Their blood will be on the hands of
America&#8217;s leadership.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday&#8217;s meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and PLO
terror boss Mahmoud Abbas and its immediate aftermath makes it painfully
obvious why peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
need to be called off. Every clear-thinking observer has been noting for
months how ridiculous it is for Israel to negotiate with Abbas, while a
Hamas still unswervingly dedicated to Israel&#8217;s destruction is the one
that decides whether or not any deals he makes are actually implemented.
Abbas&#8217; promise to Olmert on Sunday to release abducted IDF soldier Gilad
Shalit, and Hamas&#8217; reaction to that commitment is just a preview of how
the entire &#8220;peace&#8221; process will play out under these circumstances.
Abbas assured Olmert that Shalit will be freed before the official
formation of a unity government with Hamas. In other words, Shalit
should be home with his family within the week. That is, if Abbas could
be trusted or actually had any power to follow through on his promises.
But he doesn&#8217;t. Hamas is holding the reins. And Hamas spokesman Rezi
Hamed <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1770">made perfectly clear on
Monday</a> that the terror group has
no intention of honoring any commitments made by Abbas that it does not
feel fall in line with its interests. So why in the world is Israel
negotiating with Abbas? Why is it being forced to accept (or willing to
accept) Abbas as the &#8220;negotiating component&#8221; of the new Palestinian
government if he is unable to actually carry through on what he says? Of
course, this is how the entire peace process has progressed until now.
The Palestinian leadership makes promises, and then either fails to
honor them or does the exact opposite. Israel has accepted that reality
for so long that I guess the only thing left is to pick the most nicely
dressed Palestinian with which to participate in photo-ops. Fortunately,
a ground swell is forming among an Israeli public that is finally
beginning to understand just how deeply it has been betrayed by those
more interested in signing worthless scraps of paper than pursuing real
peace. According to a recent poll, a firm 56% majority of Israelis say
the internationally-backed &#8220;two-state solution&#8221; to the conflict is
<a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=33376">simply not workable with the current Palestinian
leadership</a>. It is high time
the international community, and Washington in particular, starts to
respect Israel&#8217;s national interests as defined by Israel itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No nation on earth can make peace with a neighbor steeped in violent
tendencies, that <a href="http://pmw.org.il/bulletins_feb2007.htm#b280207">teaches its future generations to hate and seek
death</a> while doing as
much harm as possible to its enemies. And yet, the world demands that
Israel do just that - make peace with a Palestinian Arab society that
cannot even keep from killing each other. All the nice declarations of
unity and brotherhood aside, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; are <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894576265&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">demonstrating for
everyone</a>
that the only language they know and understand is the language of
violence. Even when speaking among themselves. This shouldn&#8217;t be a
difficult concept for the West to grasp. During World War II, the Allies
battled two societies that were likewise taught to see violence as the
answer to every question: Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Back then,
the West understood that merely entering into peace negotiations with
these enemies would not be enough, it would not alter their violent
character. No, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan had to be completely
re-educated. Why does anyone think the Arab Middle East (and the
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; in particular), which has for decades taught its people to
view Israel as a cancer that must be eradicated, is any different?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amidst the din of weeks of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; infighting, the media can be
excused for missing the story that since December 1, <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/015503.php">Muslim terrorists
have bombed 45 Internet cafes in the Gaza
Strip</a>. Forty-five! In
three months! Imagine if that was happening in the US. It would be
declared a terror epidemic. But alas, this is only the latest example of
the Palestinian Arabs&#8217; propensity for economic self-destruction.
Remember after the Gaza &#8220;disengagement&#8221; of 2005, when Israel left
millions of dollars worth of advanced farming equipment and greenhouses
behind for the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to use? And remember how the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; promptly destroyed everything? Thousands of Gazan Arabs
are today living on pennies because their own people are blowing up
their family businesses and burning down generous agricultural gifts
from Israel and the the international community. And still, everyone
insists that it&#8217;s Israeli checkpoints that are the only barrier to an
explosion of growth in the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; economy. Right. If the peace
activists and foreign diplomats really want to better the lives of the
Palestinian Arabs, maybe they should focus less attention on criticizing
Israel and more on convincing the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to actually behave like
a civilized and productive society. If they did, there would be no need
for the Israeli checkpoints.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3371556,00.html">Several</a>
<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3371682,00.html">stories</a>
over the past week tell tales of Muslim children from across the region
receiving critical and life-saving medical care at the hands of &#8220;evil&#8221;
Zionist doctors. While not at all uncommon, stories of Israeli goodwill
toward the citizens of enemy nations are typically ignored by the
mainstream media. That probably saves the press from having to compare
and contrast the bestial behavior of those enemies toward Israeli Jews.
Can you imagine Syria or even Egypt inviting Israelis to come receive
free life-saving medical care, let alone visit the country as Israeli
Jews without having to fear for their lives? I for one want to voice my
huge support for these efforts to bring Arab children to Israel for
medical care and to teach them by example what their schoolbooks will
not: that the Jews are a good and caring people who want nothing but to
live in peace with their neighbors. One Christian-run organization
participating in this effort to break down the walls of hate is Shevet
Achim. <a href="http://www.shevet.org/">Check them out</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Always the smooth talker, Jordan&#8217;s King Abdullah II on Friday said that
Israel needs to choose between <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894559202&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">maintaining a &#8220;fortress mentality&#8221; and
living in peaceful coexistence with its Arab
neighbors</a>.
What Abdullah forgot to mention is that Israel today has a fortress
mentality because its Arab neighbors have never demonstrated anything
but a desire to annihilate the Jewish state. Kind of hard to not develop
a fortress mentality when your neighbors are constantly trying to kill
you. This is nothing but another Arab attempt to further turn the
diplomatic tables on Israel and demonize its efforts to defend its
citizens. More on this from <a href="http://www.yourish.com/2007/03/03/2817">Meryl

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For decades, Israel&#8217;s enemies made no pretense of desiring peace with
the Jewish state, and instead attempted at every opportunity to destroy
the nation militarily. When it became clear that that was not going to
happen, at least not under present circumstances, the Arab nations
turned to diplomacy, albeit in a relatively hostile manner, to achieve
their aims. While those hostile diplomatic efforts continue, it appears
some of Israel&#8217;s Arab enemies are beginning to realize that they have a
better chance of success if they offer more carrot and less stick. And
so we find ourselves in a situation today where many <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/832406.html">officials in
Jerusalem are getting all
excited</a> about the
prospect of the Arab League, meeting later this month in Riyadh,
removing the one really disagreeable clause from an otherwise acceptable
Saudi peace proposal first presented in 2002. That proposal offers
Israel peace and normal relations with the entire Arab world in return
for a full surrender of the Golan Heights, Judea, Samaria and eastern
Jerusalem. Now, while Israeli politicians are wary of offering to give
up all that land, most are sadly willing to part with a great deal of
their biblical patrimony for the promise of &#8220;peace.&#8221; The only part of
the Saudi proposal that even the current defeatist government was unable
to swallow was the demand that Israel allow millions of so-called
&#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; to take up residence inside the borders of
sovereign Israel - which would of course spell the end of the Jewish
state. With the Saudis and others increasingly trying to sweet-talk
Israel into signing a proverbial &#8220;deal with the devil,&#8221; it is not
unfathomable that the Arab League will agree to at least downgrade the
whole &#8220;Palestinian right of return&#8221; demand. And if that happens, many
will ask, &#8220;So, why not agree to the deal if Israel is for the most part
getting everything it ever asked for?&#8221; From a human perspective, there
is one very good reason to still reject the proposal even if the
&#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; are completely written out of it, and that reason
is the volatility of the Middle East. Israel could surrender its most
strategically important regions (the Golan, Jordan Valley and central
hill region) in return for peace with the current Arab regimes, but in
this neighborhood, you never know who will be in power tomorrow. There
is no guarantee that 5, 10 or 20 years down the road, violently
anti-Israel dictators just crazy enough to go to war will not be in
power in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. From a biblically-minded
perspective, the aim of the true Enemy is, of course, to reverse the
God-ordained restoration of Israel and thereby attempt to prevent the
final fulfillment of the divine plan of global redemption.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is no secret any longer that the Arab states of the Middle East have
no intention of resettling the so-called &#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; and
easing their lives. They are far too valuable as diplomatic pawns in the
great quest to destroy Israel. What is a real shame, though, is that
nations like the United States do not demand that the UN stop helping
the Arabs to perpetuate the daily suffering of these people. Last week,
the special UN agency created just for the &#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221; (no
special agency was every created for any other group of refugees)
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/831303.html">launched a fund-raising
campaign</a> to fix up a
&#8220;refugee camp&#8221; in Syria. They want to do a few repairs so they can keep
these 18,000 people living in an old World War II military camp instead
of allowing them to join the rest of Arab Muslim society around them.
Remember, before the rebirth of Israel, the Arabs of the area labeled
&#8220;Palestine&#8221; by the British <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/greater-syria">viewed themselves as residents of &#8220;Greater
Syria.&#8221;</a> Now they are taught
by the Arabs and the international community to view themselves as
refugees in a foreign land.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the primary tenets of the &#8220;Oslo&#8221; peace accords signed between
Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 was that both sides would educate
their populations for peace with the other. With half of Israel&#8217;s
population running about demanding capitulation to Arab demands even in
the absence of Arab compliance and a majority of Israelis willing to
make territorial compromises, we know Jerusalem has more than kept its
side of the bargain. But how have the Palestinians fared in this regard?
The results of an internal Palestinian opinion poll conducted last month
demonstrate precisely how Palestinian youth have been taught to view
Israel since those accords were signed nearly 14 years ago. Asked
whether or not they believe Israel even has a right to exist, a whopping
90% of Palestinians aged 18-25 - those who came up through the education
system in the wake of &#8220;Oslo&#8221; - <a href="http://www.neareastconsulting.com/surveys/all/p22/out_ct_age_q26.php">answered in the
negative</a>.
These are the young minds that should have been most easily educated to
seek peaceful coexistence with Israel. Instead, they were educated to
hate. <a href="http://pmw.org.il/bulletins_feb2007.htm#b280207">Palestinian Media Watch
notes</a> that with a
school curriculum that teaches them to utterly and violently reject the
Jewish state&#8217;s existence: > &#8220;The well-meaning (Palestinian) student is
left with no logical justification or religious option to accept Israel
as a neighbor&#8230;&#8221; I would like to add those guilty of teaching
Palestinian youth to view the situation in this way are not the PA&#8217;s new
Hamas overlords, but rather PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas and his fellow
&#8220;moderates&#8221; in the Fatah faction. I speak often of Abbas making himself
a fig leaf for Hamas&#8217; virulent platform, but the fact is that Hamas is
equally a fig leaf for Abbas and the non-compliance of his colleagues.
The international community and media are so focused on the anti-Israel
positions of Hamas and its refusal to change them that they have
conveniently forgotten that Abbas and his ilk are in fact perpetuating
the conflict by teaching the next generation to reject Israel. Or maybe
it&#8217;s not forgetfulness. Maybe the world was looking for an excuse to not
have to admit that Abbas may not be the &#8220;moderate&#8221; they say he is. Lord
knows they held out on acknowledging Arafat&#8217;s true nature for as long as
possible, and then some.</p>
