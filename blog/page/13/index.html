  <div class="entry-content"><p>Going into Monday&#8217;s three-way summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert and PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas, visiting US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice admitted there was no evidence that the new
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; unity government was ever going to <a href="http://www.bakutoday.net/view.php?d=33689">comply with
international demands that it recognize Israel&#8217;s right to
exist</a>. That being the case,
wouldn&#8217;t now be the time to accept that the current Palestinian Arab
leadership (Abbas and Hamas and everyone in-between) simply does not
represent a viable peace partner for Israel? Wouldn&#8217;t now be the time to
accept that the Oslo/Road Map peace process is a failure, and that we
need some alternative options? Rice apparently feels that the answer to
those questions is a resounding &#8216;NO&#8217;. Despite the fact that even she now
admits the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have a government that will never actually
implement any peace deal it signs with Israel, Rice insists direct talks
with the Abbas-controlled half of the PA must continue. Why? To what
end? Hamas won&#8217;t support any deal that grants Israel any shred of
legitimacy or a respite from terrorism, and Abbas is clearly in no hurry
to force the Islamists into compliance. In fact, this whole affair
should be evidence enough for Washington and Jerusalem of Abbas&#8217; true
interests. For months, the media has been going on and on about how
Abbas was trying to &#8220;moderate&#8221; Hamas so that peace could be achieved.
But if that was true, then why did he not make recognition of Israel and
a renunciation of terrorism the cornerstones of the power-sharing deal
signed in Mecca? No, what was more important to him was internal
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; unity (meaning unity with the Hamas terrorist
organization), and his own party&#8217;s insertion into the government to act
as a fig leaf for Hamas&#8217; virulent positions, thereby giving the
international community the opportunity it needed to restart the flow of
funds. For Abbas, it&#8217;s about money and power, not peace. For Hamas, it&#8217;s
about destroying Israel. Turns out their true interests are not in
opposition to one another after all. Rice&#8217;s open realization of this
makes the US government all the more complicit in the murder of every
Israeli by this terrorist entity that it refuses to terminate its
relationship with. JoshuaPundit has an <a href="http://joshuapundit.blogspot.com/2007/02/ahhhhh-yesanother-mideast-peace-summit.html">excellent, like-minded
take</a>
on the situation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The United States has a well-known policy (in theory) of not negotiating
with terrorists. Unfortunately, that policy often takes a back seat to
the politically-correct leanings of liberal politicians seeking to leave
a legacy of &#8220;peace.&#8221; We saw the two sides of this coin at work this week
when <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/015282.php">the US Congress put a freeze on plans to dole out American
taxpayers&#8217; money to a terror-supporting Palestinian
Authority</a>, while
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1659">Condoleezza Rice refused to give the Palestinians an
ultimatum</a> regarding that same
nefarious support for the killing of Jews. (This despite earlier reports
that the Bush admin was going to <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/009180.php">do the right
thing</a>.)
Rice and the rest of the Bush Administration feel that they **must**
secure some kind of peace agreement between Israel and the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; before the upcoming 2008 US presidential election. And so
we see Rice very clearly being taken in by PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas&#8217;
sweet talk about how in the new PA government he and his fellow
&#8220;moderates&#8221; will take responsibility for negotiations with Israel, while
those nasty Islamists handle the internal &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; affairs. Rice
and Bush are so desperate to bring &#8220;peace&#8221; to the Middle East that they
are ready to accept this ludicrous situation, brushing aside the fact
that any agreement Abbas may come to with Israel will never actually be
implemented without the support of Hamas - well, the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
obligations contained in the agreement won&#8217;t be implemented. Abbas is
nothing more than a smooth-talking, well-dressed fig leaf masking the
true intentions of the Palestinian Arabs, as embodied in the virulent
Hamas platform that they overwhelming voted for last year. You can&#8217;t
make peace with half of a government, while the other half remains
openly dedicated to your destruction. Let us pray that the Congress
makes the right decision and does not make the American people, through
their money, party to this dangerous deception.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The IDF got a new chief on Wednesday - Lt.-Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, the 19th
man to have the honor of leading the Israel Defense Forces. By all
accounts, Ashkenazi is extremely popular with IDF field commanders. May
the Almighty grant him wisdom and strength to go along with that
popularity. He is going to need it. Israeli defense analysts warn that
the next war with Hizb&#8217;allah, and probably Syria too, is just around the
corner, perhaps as early as this coming summer. Problem is that after
last summer&#8217;s debacle in Lebanon, most Israeli reservists - fathers,
husbands and sons who put their lives on the line to defend the nation -
feel apprehensive about being sent again into battle. It didn&#8217;t used to
be that way. It wasn&#8217;t that way prior to and during the last war. But as
the upper echelons of the political and military leadership increasingly
tied the hands of the reservists in the field as they battled to destroy
Hizb&#8217;allah, those same reservists began to feel that they had been
slapped in the face, cynically used as political pawns. They could have
won. They should have won. But instead so many of them died without
achieving victory so that Ehud Olmert, Amir Peretz and other would not
be too badly tarnished in the international press. May Gabi Ashkenazi
have the strength, wisdom and fortitude to lead his men to victory even
when the politicians are only looking out for themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A leading Egyptian lawmaker from dictator Hosni Mubarak&#8217;s own party
suggested on Monday that the Muslim world <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359843490&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">nuke
Israel</a>
in order to stop it from doing excavation and renovation work in its own
capital. Said Mohammed el-Katani of Israel&#8217;s renovation of a collapsed
earthen ramp leading to the only Temple Mount gate available to
non-Muslims: > &#8220;The cursed Israel is trying to destroy the Al-Aqsa
Mosque. Nothing will work with Israel except for a nuclear bomb that
wipes it out of existence.&#8221; This is a statement by a prominent lawmaker

anyone imagine British lawmakers opposed to the foreign policies of U.S.
President George W. Bush suggesting that Europe nuke America into
oblivion in order to relieve their displeasure?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is Prime Minister Ehud Olmert trying to prepare Israelis for the
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1648">surrender of the Golan Heights to
Syria</a>? On Monday, Olmert
explained in detail to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
that the only thing that would buy Israel peace with Syria would be
ceding the entire Golan. He expounded on the issue despite stating that
he remains opposed to negotiations with Damascus at this time. For
anyone who remembers the trial balloons Olmert floated back when
surrendering the Gaza Strip was unthinkable to most, his latest comments
are cause for great concern. Olmert is trying to get Israelis used to
the notion that one day they will have to give up the strategic northern
plateau that has kept them safe from Syrian aggression for so many
decade. Imagine what would have happened in the 1973 Yom Kippur War if
the Syrian Army hadn&#8217;t needed to cross an Israeli-controlled Golan to
reach the rest of the country? What&#8217;s worse, Olmert is giving Damascus
the green light to make Israel&#8217;s full and complete surrender of the
Golan a non-negotiable demand. When in the future Damascus refuses to
compromise on the issue, they can point to Olmert&#8217;s position as
justification for their own. The Israelis have got to get this guy out
of office before he causes further damage to Israel&#8217;s security and opens
the door for the slaughter of many more of his countrymen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t want to get too far ahead of myself, but I would not be at all
surprised if Israel&#8217;s current renovations outside Jerusalem&#8217;s Temple
Mount <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1644">spark a new &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror
war</a>. Remember, the previous
&#8220;intifada&#8221; - dubbed the &#8220;Oslo War&#8221; by Israelis and the &#8220;Al Aqsa
Intifada&#8221; by the Arabs - was, according to the Arabs, a justified and
legitimate response to Ariel Sharon&#8217;s 2000 Rosh Hashanah visit to the
Temple Mount. If you listen to local and regional Muslim leaders, they
are issuing very similar calls to those heard in 2000 inciting the
Palestinian Arabs to &#8220;defend&#8221; the Al Aqsa Mosque that, along with the
Dome of the Rock, occupies the Temple Mount. Those calls are being
answered - perhaps slowly, but in an escalating manner. So far, the IDF
has registered nearly 100 rock and firebomb attacks on Jews in Judea and
Samaria since last Thursday. And Hamas officials are calling for
official Palestinian Authority armed violence against Israel. The
renovations at the Temple Mount are slated to last a full year. Believe
me, it won&#8217;t take that long until this powder keg explodes. The question
is how will Israel deal with the war forced upon it this time. Will the
totally inept Olmert government fight back with token military strikes
while continuing the ludicrous effort of trying to negotiate with the
Mahmoud Abbas-controlled half of the PA? (Very similar to how Olmert is
handling the ongoing rocket attacks from Gaza.) Or will we see, as
happened in 2000, the leftist government crumble amid renewed
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorism, and the election of a strong right-wing
government willing to take the fight to the enemy (at least initially)?
You can be sure one of the two is going to happen sooner rather than
later. My vote is with option #2, judging by the fact that Olmert is
already hugely unpopular in Israel because of his failure to lead the
nation to victory in Lebanon. One last note: Isn&#8217;t it sad how willing
the Arabs are to fight for control of the Temple Mount, even to the
extent of making up lies, while the Israelis in general are so apathetic
regarding Judaism&#8217;s and the Bible&#8217;s holiest site? A major prayer point,
if you ask me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last week <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359815963&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">belatedly
recognized</a>
that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of Mahmoud Abbas may
not be a viable peace partner for Israel after all. Too bad her husband
already made that realization completely irrelevant by helping to
immutably entrench the PLO den of killers as celebrated, peace-seeking
international diplomats. And let&#8217;s not forget that Hillary is on the
campaign trail, and she was speaking to a Jewish audience. If, heaven
forbid, she manages to become the next president of the US, no one can
honestly believe that she would support kicking the PLO to the curb and
completely rethinking the &#8220;peace&#8221; process. Like every other American
president, Hillary would be more concerned about her own political
future and legacy, and would without doubt fall prey to the Palestinian
apologists that occupy the State Department. Nor would Hillary be able
to avoid pandering to the anti-Israel sentiments of the Arab world that
control so much of the oil that fuels the American economy, despite her
ranting about the current administration&#8217;s apparent basing of foreign
policy on such energy concerns. All the talk of developing alternative
sources of energy and becoming energy-independent is nice, but Hillary
knows as well as anyone that to suddenly stop buying so much oil from
Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world would cause an international
diplomatic crisis of enormous proportions that would be far more deadly
that forcing American consumers to continue paying rising gas prices. So
all the strong statements aside, it is extremely unlikely (barring
direct divine intervention) that the future president of the United
States, be it Hillary Clinton or anyone else, will give the Arab world
the finger and tell the PLO to go to hell.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mainstream media is predictably underreporting the Muslim uproar
over Israel&#8217;s minor renovation work outside the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem. What they are failing to point out is that the work being
done is to stabilize the earthen ramp leading to the Mugrabi Gate, the
sole access point to the Temple Mount for Jews and Christians. If this
ramp is not repaired, the Mugrabi Gate will become unusable, meaning
that only Muslims will ever be able to ascend the Temple Mount. My bet
is that the Muslims want precisely that. Right-thinking Israeli lawmaker
Aryeh Eldad <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=121206">said as much last
week</a> in an
interview with Arutz 7: > &#8220;The Arabs actually want the Mughrabi Gate
passway to collapse so that they will be able to close the only gate
that is under Jewish control. That will end the era of Jewish visitation
rights to the Temple Mount. They have been waiting for this for a long
time, and that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t want us to refurbish it. What is also
being completely ignored by the press is the fact that the Muslims have
for years been conducting unauthorized and unsupervised excavations
under the Temple Mount that have turned thousands of years of Jewish
history to rubble. And yet, the Arab League&#8217;s claim that Israel is
distorting the face of Jerusalem is made a top headline. Typical
hypocrisy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A mob of Palestinian Arab youth <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359824293&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">violently attacked a tour bus carrying
Canadian
pilgrims</a>
at the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem on Saturday. The attack, which was
perpetrated with stones and glass bottles, came amid Muslim riots
related to very minor Israeli renovation work on an earthen ramp leading
to the Temple Mount. And the Palestinians wonder why towns such as
Bethlehem and Ramallah receive no tourists. It&#8217;s not because of Israeli
roadblocks. It&#8217;s because the violent nature of the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; -
instilled in them by their elders from a very young age, sadly - makes
those places extremely unsafe for visitors. Just think about it this way
- the entire region (Israel, Judea, Samaria, etc) has for the past
decade been embroiled in a pretty violent situation. And yet, foreigner
tourists continue flocking to Israel. The Palestinian
Authority-controlled territories, however, they avoid like the plague.
That is because one population is prone to wild outbursts of violence,
while the other is only trying to live in peace and security, employing
violence and force only as necessary for its own protection. Regardless
of what the newspapers print, visitors to the Holy Land are perfectly
aware of who is the aggressor, and they are showing it with their feet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3363115,00.html">is again playing
dumb</a>,
publicly asserting that the Palestinians, who can&#8217;t even keep from
slaughtering themselves, are opposed to the policies of the violently
anti-Israel Hamas terrorist organization. This is really getting old.
Hamas DOES represent the wishes and interests of the general Palestinian
Arab public, the same public that overwhelmingly voted the terror group
into office just one year ago. The &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; knew perfectly well
what they were voting for, too. Whatever else Hamas does on the side, it
is known first and foremost, even among the &#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; as an
organization dedicated to the utter destruction of Israel through
violent means. On the other side, the so-called &#8220;moderates&#8221; - the PLO,
Abbas, Fatah, etc - are willing to negotiate right now only because they
know they are not yet capable of physically destroying Israel. But in
their hearts, what they also really want is for the Jewish state to
disappear. Israel needs to remember that those it now hails as
peace-loving moderates (like Abbas his sidekick, Mohammed Dahlan) were
just 15 years ago as openly engaged in the mass murder of Israeli Jews
with the goal of annihilating the Jewish state as Hamas is today.
Destroying Israel was and remains their raison d&#8217;etre. Need proof? Look
at just about any Palestinian Authority-approved grade school textbook.
There were plenty of other factions the Palestinian Arabs could have
voted for last January, but just about all of them cast their ballots
for Hamas and the PLO. The votes don&#8217;t lie: the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; want
Israel gone.</p>
