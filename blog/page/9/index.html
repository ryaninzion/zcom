  <div class="entry-content"><p>Driving to work this morning, I passed a sign that read &#8220;Assad is
waiting for Olmert to make peace.&#8221; It never ceases to amaze me that all
the Arabs have to do to &#8220;prove&#8221; they want peace is utter a few
semi-conciliatory words in English, while Israel is required to give
something tangible or risk being viewed as an obstacle to peace. What&#8217;s
worse is that so many Israelis now buy into this line of reasoning.
Peace Now, the organization behind the sign, by no means represents a
majority of Israelis in its thinking, but a sizable minority does
subscribe to its skewed view of reality. Let&#8217;s lay this one out
logically: - Syria tries on three separate occasions to militarily
annihilate the Jewish state; - During one of those attempts, Syria loses
control of the Golan Heights to Israel; - Syria goes on to forge close
ties with every anti-Israel terrorist organization willing to do so and
allows them to set up offices and training camps inside the country; -
Despite all this, Israel wants peace so bad that it - the victorious
victim of aggression - is willing to discuss surrendering some of the
strategic land won from its attacker; - However, until Israel actually
hands over at least part of the Golan, it is labeled an obstacle to
peace, even by some of its own citizens; - Meanwhile, Assad, who still
supports and aids terror groups from Hizb&#8217;allah to Hamas, tells a few
magazines that he is ready for &#8220;peace,&#8221; but only on Syria&#8217;s terms, and
for that he is declared a man of peace eagerly awaiting proper
reciprocation from his intractable Israeli neighbors. In what other part
of the world would this nonsense fly? We need to pray for these
Israelis, that they will stop allowing themselves to be blinded to
reality and to their historical and biblical rights in this land by a
world that would like nothing more than to see the Jewish state
disappear.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an interview with _The Jerusalem Post_ this week, British
Ambassador to Israel Tom Phillips contended that Israel&#8217;s negative image
in Britain and the world stems from it being an &#8220;occupying power.&#8221; He
couldn&#8217;t be more wrong. Phillips, who <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708564898&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">tried to strike a conciliatory
note toward
Israel</a>
in the interview, appears to suffer from the same shortness of memory
that plagues most Israeli and Western officials caught up in trying to
solve the Israeli-Arab conflict. When Phillips and other Western
diplomats speak of the &#8220;occupation&#8221; today, they are referring to
Israel&#8217;s control of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip, areas which were
liberated by Israel in 1967. But even before 1967, Israel was regularly
demonized by the mainstream international press and the Arab world
because of its very existence. There was no &#8220;occupation&#8221; in the way the
international community speaks of it today, but still Israel was
criticized as an &#8220;occupying power.&#8221; So, Mr. Phillips is wrong. Even if
Israel surrenders every piece of land the so-called Arab &#8220;moderates&#8221; are
demanding today, the critical press Israel&#8217;s receives will not cease.
The Arabs, even the &#8220;moderates,&#8221; have made it perfectly clear that they
eventually want all of the land today ruled by the Jews. The problem for
them is Israel itself. And the international community and its press
have an unfortunate tendency of unquestionably flowing with the changing
dictates of the Arab world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the Lebanon war behind us, and Israeli politicians trying to do
anything to divert attention from the damning Winograd Commission
findings, the lie that Israel must surrender its Arab-dominated biblical
heartland in order to survive as both a Jewish state and a democracy is
again a favorite topic of discussion. Earlier this week, Defense
Minister Amir Peretz blasted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for failing to
come up with a new diplomatic plan vis-a-vis the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; after
the Lebanon war forced him to shelve his proposed &#8220;realignment.&#8221; Now a
<a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010030">top Israeli political
analyst</a>
says Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is again formulating what she believes
is a &#8220;realistic&#8221; vision for peace. Livni has <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/843">done this once
before</a>, parroting the popular
&#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; that Israel simply cannot hold on to Judea,
Samaria and Gaza because doing so would upset the demographic balance in
the Jewish state. <a href="http://www.westernresistance.com/blog/archives/003736.html">Ruy Diaz correctly notes over at Western
Resistance</a>
that Israel needs to actually defeat its enemies before any peace plan
has a chance of succeeding. You simply <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2007/03/06/you-cant-make-peace-with-a-violent-people">cannot make peace with an
undefeated
enemy</a>
still bent on your ultimate demise. But even if we were at a point that
peace deals could realistically be discussed, the argument that Israel
can only survive as a Jewish-dominated democracy by surrendering its
most strategically-valuable pieces of land <a href="http://www.zionist.com/2006/06/18/no-demographic-threat">is
ridiculous</a>.
First of all, Israel, displaying unbelievable foolishness, is relying on
Palestinian Authority-provided statistics to determine the exact
demographic balance west of the Jordan River. <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/601">Surveys guided by
scientific methods</a> rather than
Islamic interests show that the PA numbers are way off, and that Jews
are not in the minority west of the Jordan. What&#8217;s more is that there
are about 12 million Jews who do not yet live in Israel that any number
of circumstances could cause to suddenly immigrate to the land of their
forefathers. At any given time, Israel&#8217;s Jewish population could
suddenly double, or even triple. But what I really wish is that Israel&#8217;s
leaders would put aside all the numbers and statistics, and display the
kind of blind faith that those who participated in the rebirth of Israel
had 60 years ago. Jews were most decidedly <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm">a minority west of the
Jordan River prior to Israel&#8217;s Declaration of
Independence</a>. The British and
their &#8220;white papers&#8221; had made sure of that. But that did not deter David
Ben Gurion and those around him from pressing forward with the
fulfillment of a 2,000-year-old dream. Back then, Israelis knew that
somehow, despite being a minority in the land, they would prevail. The
same is undoubtedly true today. If Israel would only have the faith to
lay claim to all of its biblical birthright, it would find the numbers
miraculously working out in the Jews&#8217; favor, just as they did 60 years
ago.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t believe the hype eagerly disseminated by the mainstream media that
the Palestinian Arabs are totally united in their desire to end the
so-called &#8220;Israeli occupation.&#8221; There are a good number of
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; who long to again live under Israeli rule, recognizing
that it is only under Israel that they can live in freedom from
oppression by their own leaders. Sadly, the vast majority of these
clear-thinking Arabs do not dare to open their mouths for fear of a
brutal response by the more savage of their brethren. I have had the
pleasure of meeting one of these men, a pastor Naim Khoury of the First
Baptist Church of Bethlehem. For his open belief that all of this land
is Israel&#8217;s biblical birthright, Khoury has been ambushed and shot and
his church has been bombed 14 times. Similarly, a number of
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; residents of eastern Jerusalem have expressed to me and
others that they absolutely do not want to live under the Palestinian
Authority. Well, it now seems that many of the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; of Gaza,
who less than two years after winning their freedom from the &#8220;Israeli
occupation&#8221; are desperate for the Jews&#8217; return, are joining the ranks of
those who have seen the light. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853107.html">According to a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
journalist</a> who spoke
to _Ha&#8217;aretz_, &#8220;Many people in the Strip hope that Israel will
reoccupy it because&#8221; the violence and anarchy that has now gripped the
area was &#8220;not prevalent during the Israeli occupation [sic].&#8221; Call it
what you like, but it is an indisputable fact that Arabs living under
Israeli rule have more freedom and enjoy greater financial prosperity
than regular Arabs in just about any other part of the Middle East.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Geopolitical assessments regarding the possibility of war spewed by
United Nations officials are about as useful as bestowing Nobel Peace
Prizes on Islamic terrorists. But that doesn&#8217;t stop the geniuses at the
UN from trying to tell those far more experienced than themselves when
they should and should not be preparing for the possibility of a
conflagration. And so it was that Austrian general Wolfgang Jilke,
commander of the UN Disengagement Observer Force positioned along the
Israeli-Syrian border, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178431593760&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">scoffed this
week</a>
at Israel&#8217;s estimation that Damascus is preparing for war. Jilke stated
that according to what the Syrians had shown him, they were merely
repairing defensive positions near the border, and not conducting a
military buildup, <a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=12573">as Israel
charges</a>.
Of course, Jilke is certain the Syrians were completely open and
transparent about their moves and intentions. Jilke and his bosses at
the UN expect Israel and everyone else listening to accept his view over
those of Israeli defense experts. But has the UN ever given anyone a
good reason to accept its reading of the situation in conflict zones?
Let&#8217;s take just a quick look at the UN&#8217;s track record in this regard. -
The UN failed miserably in identifying the possibility of and preventing
the outbreak of war along the Israeli-Lebanese border, despite having a
large &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221; force deployed in southern Lebanon. - The UN failed
to effectively assess the civil strife in Sudan that has now led to a
massive unresolved humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region. - The UN
failed to adequately read the situation on the ground in Rawanda,
allowing some 1 million people to be slaughtered in a completely
avoidable orgy of violence. Those are just a few of the examples from
the past 15 years of how useless the UN is when it comes to assessing
and preventing global conflicts. Israel knows what it looks like when
its enemies are preparing for war. They have done so on numerous
occasions over the past 60 years. So I, for one, am going to continue
ignoring the Useless Nobodies (UN) and listening to Israel&#8217;s generals
when it comes to assessing the possibility of war in this region.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is in no one&#8217;s interests to create a welfare state anywhere in the
world. But that is precisely what the international community is trying
feverishly to accomplish with the division of the Land of Israel and the
creation of a Palestinian Arab state. Every indication is that
&#8220;Palestine&#8221; would be wholly dependent on international handouts and
Israel&#8217;s economic infrastructure for its survival. In short, it would be
a &#8220;sovereign state&#8221; only in name. We have already gotten a taste of this
with the now-Jew-free Gaza Strip. Two years ago, everyone was talking
about how the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; were going to turn Gaza into a model of
productivity and affluence once the Israelis were gone. I don&#8217;t think
there is any need to expound on the condition of Gaza today, on what the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have actually made of it. Seeing this &#8220;land-for-peace&#8221;
process through can only be bad for everyone involved. The international
community will be shackled with a permanent charity case that <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178198616231&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">uses
violence as
blackmail</a>
when it feels it is not receiving enough money. Israel will have its
resources and public services leeched by an entity under no obligation
to provide anything of equal value to the Jewish state in return, even
if it was capable of doing so. And the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; will continue to
live under sub-par conditions at best, as they are conditioned to beg
for the world&#8217;s scraps, rather than build themselves into a productive
society.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I started a new job this week at the Jerusalem-based news magazine
Israel Today. Started by German immigrant journalist Ludwig Schneider
more years ago than I can now remember, Israel Today bills itself as the
definitive source of news from Israel for the global Bible-believing
community, by local Israeli believers. While it was painful to walk away
from Jerusalem Newswire after having poured so much of myself into it
over the past six years, I am enjoying being at Israel Today very much.
It is a fantastic community of people here, and will offer me the
opportunity to further develop as a journalist working for an
established publication. My primary duties will be maintaining and
writing content for the website
(<a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il">www.israeltoday.co.il</a>), and developing
some of those stories into full features for the monthly magazine. If
you are not familiar with Israel Today, head over the
<a href="http://www.israeltoday.co.il">website</a> and check it out. I have long
been a fan of this publication, and would, even if I were not now an
employee, recommend everyone <a href="http://www.jerusalemdepot.com/default.aspx?tabid=157">make a
subscription</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The takeover of an empty home in Hebron by new Jewish landlords and
their tenants has presented yet another opportunity to unmask the
wretchedness and racism of Palestinian Arab society toward those it
claims to seek peace with. I am not going to get into the whole issue of
who actually holds ownership of the house in question - the new Jewish
occupants or the two different Arabs who claim the property as their
own. Others have
<a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/03/two-completely-different-stories-from.html">already</a>
<a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/03/two-completely-different-stories-from.html">addressed</a>
the matter rather effectively. What I want to do is use this story -
which naturally, despite being such a relatively insignificant matter,
is making headlines around the world because it involves &#8220;Jewish
settlers&#8221; - to highlight the fact that the Palestinian
Authority-controlled areas are one of the very few places on earth where
selling property to Jews is a crime punishable by death. And it&#8217;s not
just an informal threat of physical harm by purportedly uncontrollable
rogue militants. The Palestinian Authority has actually declared the
sale of property to Jews a crime according to the law of the land.
<a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/406">Arafat once clarified the issue</a> by
telling reporters that the offending law is: > a Jordanian law that we
inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the
death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis. &#8230; We are talking
about a few traitors, and we shall implement against them what is
written in the law books. It is actually on the books! The PA-appointed
mufti of Jerusalem <a href="http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=183013">later made it a religious crime as
well</a>. And
these are Israel&#8217;s peace partners! Who cares if the &#8220;West Bank&#8221; and Gaza
are, in the minds of some, destined to be a separate and independent
Arab-majority state. Are Jews to be forbidden to live and buy property
there based on their ethnicity? Because if so, that raises some very
troubling questions about the role of America and Europe in helping to
birth an openly racist state.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The new &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; unity government is only a few days old, but Hamas
on Monday wasted no time in implementing the power-sharing regime&#8217;s
deceptively malicious platform. Last November, Hamas agreed to
participate in an informal ceasefire between Israel and the
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; in and around the Gaza Strip. But under the terms of the
new unity government&#8217;s platform, the Hamas-led government is obligated
to safeguard the Palestinian Arabs&#8217; use of &#8220;all forms of resistance&#8221;
against Israel. And so, a gunman later identified as a member of Hamas
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879119509&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">shot and wounded an
Israeli</a>
engaged in the horrific crime of &#8230; repairing electrical equipment at
one of Gaza&#8217;s main crossing points - you know, those gates the world
wants Israel to keep open so those peaceful &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; can
infiltrate Israel at will. Hamas further adhered to the new platform by
refusing to condemn the totally unjustified shooting of an unarmed
civilian or to arrest and punish the sniper responsible. Yeah, D&#8217;Alema,
the new &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; government is <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=43529">a real
opportunity</a>, if by that
you mean an opportunity to shed more Jewish blood.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nimr Hamad, a spokesman for PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas, stated Thursday
that the new Hamas-Fatah unity government and its newly-released
platform <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/838394.html">accurately represent all Palestinian
Arabs</a>, and if Israel
refuses to make peace with that government then it refuses to make peace
with the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; in general. He is absolutely right. The new
government and its platform do in fact accurately represent the vast
majority of Palestinian Arabs. - Most &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; support the use of
terrorist violence against Israeli Jews, be they soldiers or unarmed
men, women and children. - Most &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; do not recognize Israel&#8217;s
right to exist as the only Jewish state on earth. - And most
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; hold absolutely firm to the unacceptable demand that
Israel open its borders to millions of foreign-born Arabs who claim to
be &#8220;Palestinian refugees,&#8221; thus inviting the demographic demise of the
Jewish state. Hamas&#8217; landslide electoral victory, scores of opinion
polls conducted since, and now Fatah spokesman Nimr Hamad confirm all of
this to be true. And if it&#8217;s true, then why in the world should Israel
view any of the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; as viable peace partners? How can you
view a group of people who hope for your destruction and back any
violent measures that may bring it about as peace partners? Did America
and Britain view Nazi Germany as a peace partner? At first they did, to
the great detriment of the entire world. Then they learned their lesson,
and realized that only after being crushed, defeated and reeducated
could the Germans be true peace partners. Likud lawmaker Yisrael Katz
said that Israel should respond to the new terror-supporting government
and the fact that its hostile platform does represent all &#8220;Palestinians&#8221;
- including Abbas - by <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879091737&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">completely severing ties with the Palestinian
Authority</a>.
No better advise could be given, lest Ehud Olmert become another Neville
Chamberlain.</p>
