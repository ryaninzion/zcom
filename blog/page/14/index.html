  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, the media is all abuzz over <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2006/PM%20Olmert%20meets%20with%20PA%20President%20Abbas%2024-Dec-2006.htm">Olmert&#8217;s meeting yesterday with
Abbas</a>,
and the silly notion that the coming together of the impotent
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; leader and <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1508">admittedly fatigued Israeli
premier</a> is somehow going to lead
to a final peace settlement. The fact that Olmert agreed to release some
$100 million in frozen Palestinian Arab tax revenues is being held up as
proof that progress was made. To me, the only thing that development is
proof of is that after years of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; violence and the
overwhelming election of a most blood-thirsty terrorist organization by
Israel&#8217;s &#8220;peace partners,&#8221; we are nevertheless back to the same old
routine of Israel making concessions and receiving nothing in return.
Where, pray tell, was the benefit in Saturday&#8217;s meeting for Israel? Did
Israel receive anything? Israel paid $100 million to a government that
is still effectively ruled by terrorists. Did it receive an end to
rocket fire on southern Israel? No. Did it get its abducted soldier
back? No. All Israel will receive for that $100 million is more violence
from a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; entity that is now even more confident that no
matter what it does to Israel, the parade of Jewish concessions will not
end indefinitely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I get started - a note for those who may require this disclaimer:
I was being sarcastic in my headline. On to the subject at hand. Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a new year&#8217;s greeting to the world&#8217;s
Christians this week, <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53430">urging them to behave in the way he believes
Jesus would want them
to</a>. >
&#8220;My one question of the Christians is: What would Jesus do if he were
present in the world today? What would he do before some of the
oppressive powers of the world who are in fact residing in Christian
countries? Which powers would he revive and which of them would he
destroy?&#8221; Without question, pretty much all the nations of the world
stand to receive harsh judgment at Jesus&#8217; hands. But if Ahmadinejad had
bothered to read the Bible, he would note that his own Persia is set to
receive a special reprimand, and that at Israel&#8217;s hands no less: > Thus
says the Lord God: &#8220;Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh,
Meshech, and Tubal. I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws,
and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all
splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of
them handling swords. **Persia**, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them,
all of them with shield and helmet&#8230; > > &#8220;And it will come to pass at
the same time, when Gog [and its allies] comes against the land of
Israel,&#8221; says the Lord God, &#8220;that My fury will show in My face&#8230; > >
&#8220;I will call for a sword against Gog [and its allies] throughout all My
mountains,&#8221; says the Lord God. &#8230;And I will bring [those nations] to
judgment with pestilence and bloodshed.&#8221; (Ezekiel 38:3-5, 18, 21-22) But
according to the &#8220;Gospel of Ahmadinejad,&#8221; Jesus is destined to reappear
as a mere co-messiah with the Islamic messianic figure Imam Mahdi, and
both will do the will of Allah: > &#8220;All I want to say is that the age of
hardship, threat and spite will come to an end someday and, God willing,
Jesus would return to the world along with the emergence of the
descendant of the Islam&#8217;s holy prophet, Imam Mahdi, and wipe away every
tinge of oppression, pain and agony from the face of the world.&#8221;
Unfortunately for Ahmadinejad, he and his &#8220;mahdi&#8221; are in for a big
surprise. For when Jesus returns, he is coming as the Lion of JUDAH to
establish His kingdom in and from ISRAEL, and all other nations will bow
down to Him and to the God of Israel, NOT to the moon god of Mecca. I
would like to say &#8220;what a joke!&#8221; and dismiss Ahmadinejad&#8217;s assertions as
a madman&#8217;s ramblings that will be duly ignored by all Christians. But I
know better. I know that, sadly, there are a lot of liberal, politically
correct &#8220;Christians&#8221; out there that will openly welcome this letter that
so contradicts the Word of God.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lost among the escalating violence in the Palestinian
Authority-controlled territories is the fact that the present situation
is the direct result of the Palestinian Arabs democratically deciding
that they want the worst of the terrorists among them to be their
leaders. Israel, America, Europe, everybody pressed the Palestinian
Authority to allow true democratic elections. And then the general
public overwhelmingly elected Hamas. The argument that the people voted
for Hamas based on the group&#8217;s humanitarian work and its true distaste
for the kind of political corruption that had infected the PLO just
doesn&#8217;t hold water. There were a number of other parties that ran in
last January&#8217;s election, and some of them had even greater social
agendas and were even less prone to corruption than Hamas. The reason
Hamas won the people&#8217;s hearts and minds over those other parties is
because for more than a decade it had so successfully combined caring
for the Palestinian Arabs with mass murdering Israeli Jews. Oh, and a
word on Hamas&#8217; humanitarian and charitable activities - yes, the group
does some noble work, like running orphanages and giving food and
clothes to the needy. But the catch is that they also want to recruit
your sons and daughters to blow themselves up among crowds of Zionists.
Not exactly the kind of humanitarian group I would want operating in my
neighborhood. Anyway, back on topic. The Palestinian general public -
you know, those masses of poor, suffering Arabs that the international
community insists just want to live in peace with Israel, but who are
being hijacked by a small group of radicals - yes, them - they
overwhelmingly chose a group of the most blood-thirsty terrorists as
their representatives. I repeat: They CHOSE Hamas to represent and lead
them. And they were drawn to Hamas not because Hamas promised to provide
the same services that half a dozen other parties were also promising.
No, they were drawn to Hamas because of the group&#8217;s Jewish body count;
because of the blood-drenched glory and honor Hamas had brought to the
&#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; This represents an uncomfortable truth for the West and
its land-for-peace allies among Israeli leftists. You see, the
underlying premise of all Middle East policy for the past thirty years
has been that at the core of it all, the Palestinian Arabs just want to
live in peace with their Jewish neighbors and to have a normal life. The
election of Hamas, however, proves that the vast majority of Palestinian
Arabs in fact espouse the tenets of the Hamas charter. A couple of
choice samples: - &#8220;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until
Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.&#8221;
(Preamble) - &#8220;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except
through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are
all a waste of time and vain endeavors.&#8221; (Article 13) And now everyone
is pretending that if only there can be new elections in the Palestinian
Authority reinstalling Abu Mazen&#8217;s Fatah party as the dominant political
force, then all will be well. But for those with their eyes open, it&#8217;s
too late for that. As John F. Kennedy once said: > &#8220;Peace does not rest
in charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of the
people.&#8221; What&#8217;s in the hearts of most &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; is murderous intent
toward the Jewish state. So how can there be peace?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I cannot remember the number of times I have been asked by visitors or
online friends what exactly is wrong with the Israelis, who seemingly
against all reason continue to capitulate to their enemies&#8217; demands in
some vain hope of peace. First, I would like to remind my
Bible-believing readers that this irrational behavior was foretold, and
should be expected as we near &#8220;the end.&#8221; > &#8220;Because they lead my people
astray, saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace&#8230;I will spend My wrath
against&#8230;those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw
visions of peace for her when there was no peace,&#8221; declares the
Sovereign LORD. (Ezekiel 13:10, 15-16) Well, that covers things from a
prophetic, spiritual standpoint, but even so, many still want to know
what is going on inside the heads of these Israelis, who believe that
through politically correct capitulation to Islam they can suddenly
bring to an end an existential religious war that has been raging for
thousands of years. I think we can gain a lot of insight into what these
seekers of a false peace are thinking by examining the words of Uri
Savir, the current director of the Peres (as in Shimon) Center for
Peace. Prior to holding that position, Savir joined Yossi Beilin and
other ultra-leftists in breaching Israeli law by meeting with Yasser
Arafat&#8217;s crew in Oslo, Norway and launching the now defunct peace
process. In an opinion piece published in The Jerusalem Post on November
29 of this year, Savir states the following: > &#8220;Rather than diplomacy
being perceived as the consequence following the use of force, diplomacy
should be viewed in its classical form as a mode of peace-making.&#8221; Savir
was referring both to Israel&#8217;s conflict with the Palestinian Arabs and
America&#8217;s global war on terror. I will only address the issue as it
relates to Israel, but what I have to say certainly applies to both the
Israeli and American efforts against the Islamic foe. Savir&#8217;s above
recommendation is worrying in that it so closely resembles the
appeasement-minded policies of British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain on the eve of World War II. In his great folly, Chamberlain
took Hitler&#8217;s peace overtures to be genuine, and opted for diplomacy
over victory. Millions paid with their lives for that decision. The
situation here today is a near mirror image. The Palestinian Arabs,
Syria, Saudi Arabia, etc all talk peace when they are speaking for
international consumption. And yet, like Hitler&#8217;s Germany, those nations
are all preparing their people for Israel&#8217;s destruction. A cursory
glance at the <a href="http://www.pmw.org.il/schoolbooks.html">textbooks used in Palestinian Authority
schools</a> reveals that Arab
children are being readied to lay down their lives for the cause of
eliminating the Jewish state. Dialogue, peace and co-existence are all
noble goals, but to ignore the true intentions of your enemy while
pursuing those goals is the kind of thing that only hastens the onset of
war. Like Chamberlain,Savir and other leading Israelis are basing their
policy of diplomacy on the false assumption that when presented with
goodwill gestures and concessions their enemies will respond in kind,
rather than leverage the situation to bleed Israel even further. One
would think that Israel would well understand this, having offered and
given so much to the Palestinian Arabs over the past decade, while
receiving in return nothing but an escalation in violence. The problem
lies in the fact that at least half of Israel still views the so-called
&#8220;Oslo Accords&#8221; as a positive development, a diplomatic victory. > The
1991 Madrid Conference &#8220;launched bilateral negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority&#8230; It may be the time for a second Madrid
Conference, serving to launch similar negotiations,&#8221; writes Savir.
Actually, the negotiations that were started were between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the world&#8217;s former foremost
terrorist network, the AlQaeda of its day. And in addition to creating
dialogue, this &#8220;peace&#8221; process provided the PLO with vast supplies of
arms and bases from which to operate in the heart of ancient Israel -
factors that have directly contributed to the murder and maiming of
thousands of Israelis. Difficult to see how this was a desirable
development, or one that should be repeated. These Israelis also
mistakenly believe that to the Muslim masses economic rewards are more
important than adherence to Islam, which demands that infidel tumors in
the heart of formerly Muslim-ruled lands must be removed. > &#8220;American
and Israeli peace policy should seek a comprehensive package in which
Israel would enjoy diplomatic relations with all Arab countries and the
Middle East would enjoy regional economic development with open borders
for trade&#8230;&#8221; You ever wonder why the heir of a construction empire like
Osama bin Laden would choose to dwell in caves in Afghanistan and live
the life of a terrorist on the run? It&#8217;s because for true believers in
Islam, adherence to Allah&#8217;s dictates are more important than money and
comfortable living. This is also demonstrated in the fact that surveys
show a large percentage of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; homicide bombers were not poor
and desolate, but rather hailed from educated middle-class families. To
the purely secular mind that rejects the role of religion and faith in
such matters, and assumes that all sides are approaching the problem
with the same set of morals and desires - to that mind, all this talk of
a &#8220;new Middle East&#8221; and cooperative regional development sounds
perfectly reasonable. But it is that mind that has chosen to live in
blindness. It is that mind that has forgotten that without God&#8217;s Word,
without His divine appointment, Israel simply does not exist at all.
Fortunately, there is a sizable remnant in Israel that has its eyes
open, that is living according to and standing firmly upon the divine
promises made to their people. It is time we work to strengthen their
hands, rather than stand idly by as they are ripped from their homes by
short-sighted leaders who offer nothing but a false peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While most of the mainstream media is extra careful to not label the
members of Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas as
terrorists, there are some who refuse to be so &#8220;open minded&#8221; as to
afford the murderers of men, women and children any such courtesy. That
minority of journalists, however, is often accused of unfairly slanting
the news and driving away the average user with &#8220;subjective&#8221; language.
Now, to get &#8220;objective&#8221; for a moment, a case can be made for not
regularly referring to Hezbollah as a terror group. While Hezbollah has
been involved in such clear acts of terrorism as the 1994 bombing of a
Jewish community center in Argentina, the bulk of its activities in
recent years do not fall under the definition of classical terrorism.
The case can be made that at present, Hezbollah would be more accurately
described as an armed militia, albeit an illegal one that international
law demands be disarmed. Hamas and other Palestinian groups, however, do
not merit any such consideration, as they have openly and proudly
claimed credit up until the present fornumerous actions with the sole
aim of mass murdering Israeli civilians - the very definition of
terrorism. To refuse to refer to Hamas and these other groups as
terrorists is the same as refusing to refer to Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al
Qaeda as a terrorist organization. Many journalists will point to the
fact that popular opinion among Middle East Arab Muslims is that Hamas
is not a terror group, and so to refer to it as such would be an
exercise in subjectivity by presenting events through a
Western,Judeo-Christian lens. But again, there are many - and I mean
very many - in the Middle East who likewise do not see Al Qaeda as a
terrorist organization. Assuming that these journalists view the bombing
of buses, cafes and shopping malls as acts of terrorism, then it only
follows that those who commit such atrocities are in fact terrorists. If
AlQaeda are terrorists for crashing airliners into the World Trade
Center, then Hamas are terrorists for blowing up passenger buses in
downtown Jerusalem. So what differentiates the two groups? Why is one
group comfortably referred to as being terrorist in nature, while
journalists so vigorously refuse to apply the same label to the other?
Some will note that Hamas, like Hezbollah, is also a political party,
deeply involved in Palestinian government. But that argument breaks down
once you note that the Taliban and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -
just to name a couple - were or still are likewise involved in
government. The true differentiating factor - and one that the media
will never admit to - is that while Al Qaeda is killing all manner of
Westerners, Hamas is devoted solely to the murder of Jews, and
specifically those Jews who dare to take up residence in their ancient,
formerly Muslim-dominated homeland. Don&#8217;t believe me? Think I am
unjustly playing the anti-Semitism card? Look at it this way: 1. A
person straps a bomb to his body and purposely detonates said bomb on
board a packed passenger bus; 2. Tens and perhaps hundreds of people are
either killed or maimed as the intended result of that action; 3. A
group or organization releases a statement to the effect that the bomber
was one of its own and was acting on its behalf; 4. The leaders of the
attacked nation or community make concessions to the assailants in hopes
of forestalling future violence. Anywhere else in the world, this is
terrorism. Terrorism by its very definition has occurred: Unarmed
civilians have been terrorized through violence with the aim of
extracting political concessions. Those who have engaged in this
practice are terrorists. Sorry to play the same old card again, but to
apply a double standard and not recognize the perpetrators of such a
strategy as terrorists just because the victims are Israeli Jews is
anti-Semitism.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The globally-acclaimed ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority in and around Gaza is death in disguise for the residents of
southern Israel. And it&#8217;s not even a very good disguise, nor is it a new
one. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1427">insists Israel is strong
enough</a> to take the chance and
see if this time will be different: > &#8220;Israel is a strong country which
can allow itself to have the strength to both fight and to also show
restraint and to give the ceasefire the possibility to succeed.&#8221; Later,
<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53106">Olmert told
reporters</a>:
> &#8220;All of these things ultimately could lead to one thing – the opening
of serious, real, open and direct negotiations between us so that we can
move forward towards a comprehensive agreement between us and the
Palestinians.&#8221; Right. And who pays the price when you are wrong? The
same people who have been paying the price for these ludicrous policies
for more than a decade now, that&#8217;s who. But the ceasefire is not really
about peace. It&#8217;s about shirking responsibility. It&#8217;s about <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/792849.html">avoiding
what really needs to be
done</a> out of a fear of
international condemnation and a desire for gentile praise. If you
really want to know what is going to happen, just <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/1433">listen to the
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terror bosses
themselves</a> - you know, the ones
Olmert and his buddies in the West are pretending they can&#8217;t hear: >
&#8220;The cease-fire offers a period of calm for our fighters to recover and
prepare for our final goal of evacuating Palestine [sic],&#8221; said Abu
Abir, spokesman for the Hamas-affiliated Popular Resistance Committees.
&#8220;We will keep fighting [Israel], but for the moment we will postpone
certain parts of the military struggle.&#8221; How many times must we go
through this charade? How many times must innocent Israeli Jews pay with
their blood so that the world can &#8220;play peace&#8221;? The &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; don&#8217;t
want peace. They openly say so. They want to fight it out. Give them
what they want!</p>

reaction is: Just how stupid do you think we are? After all, more than
1,000 Kassams have been fired at Israel from Gaza over the last 12
months, yet not a single rocket has been fired at Israel from the West
Bank during this period. So unless you believe that West Bank
terrorists, unlike their Gaza counterparts, have no desire to launch
rockets - an assumption that defies both logic and the facts (the media
periodically report on Palestinian efforts to start a West Bank Kassam
industry) - the obvious conclusion is that the army has succeeded in
preventing Kassam fire from the West Bank. > > The question, then, is
why the army has been unable to do the same in Gaza. And the answer,
quite simply, is that even before the disengagement, the army never
controlled Gaza as fully as it did the West Bank. > > &#8230; > > In
short, in the West Bank, military doctrine held that terror had to be
stopped at the source, meaning inside the towns and cities where attacks
originated. But in Gaza, there was never any attempt to control what was
happening inside Palestinian cities; the army focused instead on
perimeter defense, of both Israel and the settlements. I would add to
this that militarily squashing the Gaza rocket threat is the *only*
way to end the daily attacks on towns like Sderot. What there is not is
a political solution to the problem, because as long as they are able to
fire the rockets, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; will cling to the belief that they
can extract concessions by leveraging the violence. The &#8220;Palestinians&#8221;
must be bereft of any hope of victory over Israel, any reason to put
their trust in violence. By not crushing Gaza, Israel is allowing them
to maintain a shred of that most diabolical hope of one day destroying
Israel. Not until the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; - the sworn enemies of the Jewish
state by their own admission and actions - understand that they have
been defeated can there be any movement toward anything resembling real
peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As if its first two reports regarding the summer&#8217;s Lebanon war were not
enough, Amnesty International this week <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378445062&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">released a third
report</a>
making sure everyone is clear that it believes Israel is guilty of war
crimes. Like the first two reports, this third installment is full of
unsubstantiated accusations, Hizb&#8217;allah-tinted propaganda, and complete
ignorance of the kind of urban warfare Israel is being forced into by
its Islamic enemies. Or perhaps the ignorance is only feigned for the
sake of criticizing Israel? I don&#8217;t recall Amnesty producing such
damning reports against US forces operating in a similar fashion in
Iraq, or against Russia for its brutal military operations in Chechnya.
And if it did, they didn&#8217;t receive nearly the same media coverage.
According to the new report, Israel carried out &#8220;indiscriminate&#8221; attacks
against the Lebanese - meaning Israel didn&#8217;t care if it killed armed
Hizb&#8217;allah fighters or cute 12-year-old girls. Of course, anyone who has
bothered to acquaint themselves with Israel - with the underlying fear
of international public opinion and drives its diplomatic decisions and
the impossible level of morality that its people see themselves as bound
to - knows that Amnesty&#8217;s charge is simply not true. Furthermore, the
&#8220;human rights&#8221; organization says Israel employed massively
disproportionate force in dealing with its enemy. Does this make sense
to anyone? I mean, is Israel the only nation on earth that is not
allowed to engaged in the obviously necessary practice of employing
greater force than your enemy in order to win a war? It is a good thing
Amnesty was not around to hamper Allied war efforts during World War II,
or a good portion of the world would today be speaking German. The
report then goes on to turn its favorite screw - Israel&#8217;s use of cluster
bombs against targets in civilian areas. First of all, it is a known
military fact that cluster bombs are by far the most effective weapon
against mobile missile crews. Second, it is not Israel&#8217;s fault that
Hizb&#8217;allah missile crews operated almost exclusively out of civilian
areas. What was Israel supposed to do? Just sit back and ignore the
bombardment of its own civilians because Hizb&#8217;allah had so cleverly
shielded itself among civilians? An <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/99">accurate reading of the Fourth
Geneva Convention</a> provides Israel
full legitimacy in striking this enemy, even if it meant mass civilian
casualties. Amnesty needs to put things in perspective, and remember
that **if not for Hizb&#8217;allah** instigating the conflict and
attacking a neighboring state from inside towns and villages, **every
single one of those dead Lebanese civilians would be alive today**.
Naturally, Amnesty tried to cover itself by claiming that there was &#8220;no
evidence of Hizb&#8217;allah action&#8221; at many of the civilian sites attacked by
Israel. But, of course, there would not be. As mentioned before, the
Hizb&#8217;allah crews were highly mobile, and quickly left, or tried to
leave, after striking Israel. Furthermore, the deaths of civilians and
subsequent international condemnation of Israel is a PR victory for
Hizb&#8217;allah. Atop their agenda would be making sure there was no evidence
of terrorist activity from sites later hit by the Israelis. Amnesty is
smart enough to realize this. If only it were objective enough to
care&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone who values his or her life would naturally not put themselves
between wanted terrorist killers and the forces pursuing them. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061119/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians">It would
appear the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; don&#8217;t value their lives very
highly</a>,
despite their shrieking diatribes to the contrary, and should
subsequently stop complaining when they are killed in the crossfire of a
war their terrorist &#8220;heroes&#8221; started with Israel. I mean, if you don&#8217;t
want to die, then don&#8217;t purposely put yourself in the vicinity of men
who are daily engaged in attacking and provoking a nation stronger than
your own. Better yet, don&#8217;t allow those men to live and operate among
you in the first place. You can&#8217;t hail these killers as heroes, give
them haven, and shield them with your body and then complain when you
are caught up in the ensuing storm of violence. Like Bush once said,
either you are with the terrorists or you are with &#8220;us.&#8221; The Palestinian
Arabs have made their choice. Time to let them live (or die) with the
consequences.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has given his <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3327540,00.html">&#8220;word of
honor&#8221;</a> to
release hundreds, perhaps thousands of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; security prisoners
as a goodwill gestures he hopes will move the two sides closer to peace.
Why is this a bad idea? Two reasons. First, and most obvious, is that
doing so will encourage terrorists to carry out more of the kinds of
acts of terror they believe forced Israel to implement the release. Last
summer&#8217;s abductions of three IDF soldiers by Hamas and Hizb&#8217;allah will
be held up as what forced Israel to free the jailed &#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; and
a wave of kidnapping will ensue. The second, and more dangerous reason
why releasing &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; terrorists is an act of lunacy has to do
with legitimizing the &#8220;Palestinian cause&#8221; and its violent methods. On
the international stage, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; argue that every peace
process in modern history has been accompanied by the release of
imprisoned enemy combatants. For Israel to free jailed &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
terrorists would suggest - to the world, but more importantly to the
Arabs - that these killers are in fact legitimate combatants and that
their actions were legitimate acts of war. Either these people are
cold-blooded terrorist killers whose crimes go far beyond legitimate
resistance, or they are freedom fighters. Israel cannot have it both
ways. Even if Israel made peace with the Arabs based on the creation of
a Palestinian Arab state, the terrorist prisoners should never be
released because of the things they have done - that is how criminal
justice works. If Israel frees these murderers, it will be effectively
saying they are not criminals or murderers, but rather legitimate
freedom fighters whose actions are excusable in the framework of
national resistance. It will be spitting on the blood of its dead, and
digging the graves of the next Jewish victims.</p>
