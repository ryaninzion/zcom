<div class="entry-content"><p>US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
<a href="http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2006/special-reports/061003-rice-travels.html">suggested</a>
following talks with her Saudi counterpart on Tuesday that the Arab
world has come to a concensus on the need to recognize Israel&#8217;s right to
exist as the Jewish state. Either Rice is visiting a Middle East in some
parallel universe, or she is severely out of touch with the will of the
Arab street. As a first example, let&#8217;s take Hamas, which was the subject
of Rice&#8217;s comments. The secretary noted that Hamas was in fact duly
elected by a majority of &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; She then noted that Hamas is
bringing hardship on the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; because of its failure to join
the regional concensus on accepting Israel. But if a majority, and an
overwhelming majority at that, elected Hamas on a platform of rejecting
Israel, wouldn&#8217;t that suggest that the concensus among &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; is
that Israel has to go? <a href="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/article_1202471.php/Most_Palestinians_think_Hamas_should_not_recognize_Israel_poll">Recent opinion
polls</a>
showing that the Palestinian Arab public does not want Hamas to
&#8220;moderate&#8221; its views support this assessment. Or how about in Lebanon?
Of all of Israel&#8217;s closest Arab neighbors, Lebanon probably has the most
citizens who support Israel. Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands in a
nation of only several million <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/22/lebanon.rally.reut/">turned out last month in
Beirut</a>
for a rally in support of Hizb&#8217;allah and its mission to destroy Israel.
I don&#8217;t think we need to even touch on Syria, a nation where some of the
most vile anti-Semitic blood libels still constitute <a href="http://jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/000361.php">prime-time
television
programming</a>. Few
would back the claim that Iraqi Arabs are keen to recognize the Jewish
state simply because Saddam is now gone. In fact, just this summer their
&#8220;moderate&#8221; prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki,
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/26/AR2006072600230.html">refused</a>
during a meeting with US congressional leaders to denounce Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s
use of terrorist violence against Israel. Jordan&#8217;s King Abdullah II is a
smooth, educated man who easily wins the hearts and minds of most who
hear him. But the disdain for Israel felt by most Jordanians has been
made abundantly clear by the
<a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/627">remarks</a> and
<a href="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/10292000001.htm">actions</a> of Jordanian
lawmakers and religious officials over the years. Egypt has been at
&#8220;peace&#8221; with Israel longer than any other Arab state, but Israeli
efforts to forge a warm relationship with their southern neighbor have
proved to be in vain. As an example of Egyptian hatred for Israel,
consider that the most popular song in Egypt for years was a little tune
titled <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/07/MN6076.DTL">&#8220;I hate
Israel.&#8221;</a>
Arab leaders will say almost anything to their Western benefactors to
ensure that the flow of dollars and weapons continues. For this they are
labeled &#8220;moderates.&#8221; But their lip-service absolutely does not mean that
the Arab masses accept what Islam teaches them must be seen as an
infidel cancer in the midst of their Muslim homeland.</p>
