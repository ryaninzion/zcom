<div class="entry-content"><p>Kofi Annan and his buddies are trying really hard to keep news of
Israel&#8217;s accidental killing of four UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon
on the front pages. But the truth is, the UN itself is to blame for the
deaths of those four international troops. Israeli bombs may have
(unintentionally) taken their lives, but if UNIFIL (the UN Interim Force
In Lebanon) had done the job it was given 28 years ago, Israel wouldn&#8217;t
have to be dropping bombs at all today. UNIFIL was given a mandate in
1978 to keep hostile forces away from northern Israel and help the
Lebanese government extend its authority over southern Lebanon. It
failed miserably (or didn&#8217;t even try), leaving Israel with no choice but
to invade in 1982 and push Yasser Arafat&#8217;s PLO out of range of the
Jewish state. In May 2000, Israel gave UNIFIL another chance by vacating
southern Lebanon. But again, the &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221; force refused to do
anything about Hizb&#8217;allah&#8217;s control of southern Lebanon and aggression
against Israel. In fact, not only did UN troops sit by and watch as
Hizb&#8217;allah abducted three IDF soldiers in October 2000, it was later
discovered that the terrorists actually used UNIFIL vehicles to enable
them to get close enough to the Israelis undetected. But Israel, in its
deep desire to see the international community live up to its word,
stayed out of Lebanon and continued to entrust the safety of its
northern residents to an impotent foreign force. But the massive assault
earlier this month was the straw that finally broke the camel&#8217;s back.
Why did UNIFIL not prevent Hizb&#8217;allah from launching that provocation?
It&#8217;s almost as if the world wants Israel to get sucked into these orgies
of violence just so it has another chance to condemn the Jewish state.
UNIFIL could have avoided yesterday&#8217;s casualties by having done its job
in the first place. And after deciding not to do its job, UNIFIL should
have promptly removed its troops from the area when it became clear
Israel would have to the job for it. Helping to facilitate the creation
of a war zone, then placing your own people right in the middle of it,
and then blaming the nation suffering aggression out of that war zone
for accidentally killing your people is utter foolishness.</p>
