<div class="entry-content"><p>Much is said about the US pro-Israel lobby, but little is reported on
the pro-Islamic terrorism lobby that is equally trying to influence
America&#8217;s position vis-a-vis the Israeli-Arab conflict and global war on
terror. That probably has a lot to do the Islamic groups not calling
themselves a &#8220;terrorist lobby,&#8221; since they view the terrorists on whose
behalf they are lobbying as &#8220;freedom fighters.&#8221; As we all know, the
mainstream media is only too happy to accept and disseminate that
canard. Whether purposeful cover-up or blissful ignorance on the part of
the media, the fact remains that there are groups in the United States
aligned with &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; and other terrorist organizations pumping
money into the campaigns of Democratic hopefuls in an effort to relieve
Israel of its top ally, among other sinister motives. This phenomenon
was brought to the forefront with Representative Cynthia McKinney&#8217;s
ouster and subsequent <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/290">reelection</a>.
Having succeeded in getting McKinney back in office, it appears the
pro-Palestinian Islamists are looking to buy more Democrats. A 10-minute
reserach session on <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</a>
reveals that one Jesse Aweida and others associated with his <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/aboutus.htm">American
Task Force on Palestine</a>
are pumping money into the campaigns of several Democrats hoping to take
up or maintain residence in Washington this Fall. Thus far in the run-up
to the 2006 election, Aweida has contributed $5,500 to the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee and individual Democratic candidates,
including McKinney (GA), Mark Udall (CO), Bill Winter (CO) and Angela
Paccione (CO). Aweida and the ATFP, while operating under the guise of
respectable Arab-Americans simply concerned for the well-being of all
involved in the Middle East conflict, are in fact apologists for
Palestinian Arab terrorism, and have lobbied on behalf of the killers of
Israeli men, women and children in the past. Most open in his
pro-terrorist views has been Aweida&#8217;s partner, ATFP co-founder and
President Ziad Asali. In 2003, while still president of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Asali <a href="http://adckazoo.com/news-178.htm">wrote a letter
to then-Attorney General John
Ashcroft</a> pressing him to drop all
efforts to deport eight men associated with the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP carried out the 2001 assassination of
Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze&#8217;evi, in addition to numerous other
terrorist attacks. Under Asali&#8217;s leadership, the ADC <a href="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6173">became synonymous
with support for anti-Israel
terrorism</a>.
ATFP Executive Director Rafi Dajani is <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:UzkqS0WxkzkJ:www.wpherald.com/storyview.php%3FStoryID%3D20050920-020502-1360r+%22american+task+force+for+palestine%22+hamas+rice&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6">on
record</a>
deploring the Bush Administration&#8217;s reaction to Hamas&#8217; participation in
Palestinian Authority elections: > &#8220;Denying Hamas the chance to
participate is a sign of weakness. Hamas [the killer of thousands of
Jews] has the right to compete.&#8221; I am sure the handful of candidates
listed above are not the only ones receiving contributions from the
likes of Aweida, Asali and ATFP. It will bode ill for the Jewish state
if these anti-Israel Islamist interests manage to get a few more
McKinneys into the House. But it will bode more ill for the United
States in the long run. It would seem a concerted effort by those who
support Israel and love the true freedom offered by America&#8217;s waning
Judeo-Christian society is required to stop this slide into the Islamic
abyss before it is too late. Much of Europe has already passed the point
of no return. Now, liberals will argue that pro-Palestinian groups have
as much right as pro-Israel groups to contribute to and influence
America&#8217;s lawmakers. But these are the same people who argue that
Palestinian Arab terrorism is no different than Israel&#8217;s counter-terror
military action. Israel is a truly free, democratic nation that punishes
those of its citizens who engage in acts of terrorism, and only seeks to
defend its citizens and provide them with peace and security. The
&#8220;Palestinians&#8221; at evey level of government participate in and facilitate
the purposeful mass murder of Israeli Jews as a means of achieving
political goals. To allow interests that support this deplorable
behavior to influence our representatives in Washington is the same as
allowing interests affiliated with the Irish Republican Army to
contribute to congressional campaigns in the name of objectivity and
balance vis-a-vis the Northern Ireland conflict. It is a sick exercise
in the kind of moral equivalency that continues to fuel this conflict.</p>
