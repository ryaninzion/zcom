<div class="entry-content"><p>The ongoing Arab aggression and IDF counter-terrorist operations in and
around Gaza have sparked a revolt of sorts within Israel&#8217;s Kadima Party
against the unilateral withdrawal policies of Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert. Israel unilaterally vacated Gaza just 10 months ago, amid
government promises that the move would result in increased security and
stability for the nation. But since then terrorism has been on the rise
and the ability of Gaza-based terrorists to strike distant parts of
sovereign Israel with long-range weapons has increased exponentially.
Some senior members of Kadima, which featured a pullout from Judea and
Samaria as a central plank in its election platform, are starting to
wake up from the fantasy. > &#8220;Considering what is happening in Gaza,
opposition to the realignment is growing. &#8230;I don’t believe unilateral
steps should be made,&#8221; said Housing Minister Meir Sheetrit in an
interview with the Knesset Channel. Sheetrit was backed in that regard
by Kadima ministers Gideon Ezra and Ze&#8217;ev Boim. Then there were those
like Justice Minister Haim Ramon, who <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3273710,00.html">continued to
support</a>
Olmert in his determination to implement another withdrawal despite
present circumstances. > &#8220;The realignment and the disengagement [Gaza
pullout] were borne out of the understanding that Israel has no partner
on the other side. The events of the past few days just prove this.
Since Israel can’t be held hostage by Hamas and Kassam rockets, it must
act according to its interests.&#8221; Many are wondering if it is in Israel&#8217;s
interest to give the terrorists the kind of space that has allowed
Gaza&#8217;s &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; to launch unprecedented numbers of rockets and
plan and execute sophisticated operations like last month&#8217;s abduction of
IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit. But Olmert and his circle continue to delude
themselves into thinking the Gaza withdrawal actually improved the
security situation, and therefore sets a positve precedent for a further
surrender of &#8220;West Bank&#8221; lands. > &#8220;Today it is clear to all of us,
especially in light of the recent developments in Gaza, that it is much
easier for us to deal with the Kassams when we are out of Gaza. With all
due respect, there were more Kassam-related deaths before the
disengagement. Therefore, these developments only strengthen the notion
of realignment,&#8221; one source close to the prime minister told Ynet.
Interestingly, this official fails to mention that far more rockets are
being fired from Gaza per month since the withdrawal than before. Of
course, the fact they have caused so few casualties has nothing
whatsoever to do with the withdrawal, and is nothing short of
miraculous. Olmert&#8217;s lackey goes on to assert that the recent upgrading
of Kassams by Gaza terrorists and the increasing use of more advanced
projectiles - like the GRAD Katyusha missiles smuggled in after the
IDF&#8217;s departure - are natural evolutions of the conflict that would have
occured whether or not Israel had pulled out. > &#8220;Look at the kassam
that was fired from [the Samarian town of] Tulkarm [Sunday]; we are
there with the entire army and they still manufacture Kassams; it’s an
evolution of this war, and it has nothing to do with whether we are
there or not.&#8221; His glaring omission of the fact that, while a single
rocket was fired from Samaria, more than 1,000 have been launched from
Gaza since January alone was not lost on many. Israel&#8217;s firm presence in
Judea and Samaria has without question prevented the millions living in
Israel&#8217;s populous central regions from having to endure the kind of
artillery bombardments the residents of the Western Negev have sadly
become accustomed to. Fortunately, it appears enough of Israel&#8217;s
politicians are reaching clarity on this issue as to prevent Olmert&#8217;s
plans from every becoming reality.</p>
