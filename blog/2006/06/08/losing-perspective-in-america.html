<div class="entry-content"><p>It is amazing to me how just a few short years after 9/11 so many
Americans can have already &#8220;moved on&#8221; from that event and abandoned
their nation&#8217;s efforts to defeat the enemy that perpetrated that evil.
This disturbing account comes courtesy of <a href="http://www.changingworldviews.com/">Sharon
Hughes</a>: > **Journalists Applaud
Al-Zarqawi’s Death** > by Sharon Hughes > > Having vowed loyalty to
Osama bin Laden in 2004 and orchestrating what the Washington Post calls
the bloodiest suicide bombings of the insurgency, beheading hostages and
slaughtering thousands if Iraqis in order to incite a civil war with the
goal of driving America’s presence out of Iraq, al-Zarqawi was killed in
a U.S. air strike along with his spiritual advisor, Sheik Abdul Rahman,
on Wednesday. > > Iraqis provided the intelligence and U.S. forces
conducted 17 raids culminating in a target hit on the most-wanted
militant terrorist leader, who had the same U.S. bounty on his head as
Osama bin Laden - $25 million. > > His identity was confirmed by
fingerprints, and when Iraq’s Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced
al-Zarqawi’s death loud applause broke from Iraqi journalists. > >
What? Journalist applauding the news? Think about it. Iraqi journalists
broke out in loud applause at the news of al-Zarqawi’s death! Did
American journalists do the same when President Bush announced the news?
Or in another venue? Nope. > > The Left’s talk show hosts were off the
chart on the news. As pointed out by Tim Graham at Newsbusters: > > “I
caught some of the opening minutes of the Stephanie Miller show today
(on Air America). They were playing clips of the Rose Garden Bush
remarks and just mocking his accent. &#8220;He&#8217;s extra-twangy today,&#8221; mocked
Miller. The show&#8217;s impressionist started doing Bush in a William
Buckley-esque Connecticut accent, implying the Texas talk is all phony.
Then they began joking &#8220;we&#8217;re auditioning for a new boogey-man,&#8221; as if
Zarqawi was a phantom in a closet.” > > And on his way home from work
he caught Randi Rhodes on the same channel, who clearly is in the
running for the most biased, blind, complete spin-off-the-planet
comments! > > “Hoo boy. She was saying Zarqawi was our boy, someone we
protected in the no-fly zone from Saddam Hussein, and then used as an
excuse for war. A few minutes later, she complained it was a &#8220;sick,
psychotic&#8221; day for news, and said the rulers of America were
&#8220;imperialistic, hegemonistic&#8230;.dictators.&#8221; > > Unbelievable! The days
that follow I’m sure will find more liberal ‘reasoning’ to why catching
this mass murderer of the Iraqi people and our troops is no big deal.
Just watch. How is it that hatred for your own democratically-elected
leader can supercede the need to unite and defeat a common foe? It is
this shocking flaw in the modern liberal mindset that Islam is so
gleefully exploiting as Mohammed&#8217;s hordes advance the cause of Muslim
world domination - you know, that whole _Dar al-Harb_ / _Dar
al-Islam_ thing. America and the Judea-Christian West (because like it
or not, this is a clash of civilizations, a religious war - it always
has been) have every means of winning this fight. They can only be
defeated by their own lack of will and commitment - qualities their
Islamic enemies have in spades.</p>
