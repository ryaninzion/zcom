<div class="entry-content"><p>As if its first two reports regarding the summer&#8217;s Lebanon war were not
enough, Amnesty International this week <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378445062&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">released a third
report</a>
making sure everyone is clear that it believes Israel is guilty of war
crimes. Like the first two reports, this third installment is full of
unsubstantiated accusations, Hizb&#8217;allah-tinted propaganda, and complete
ignorance of the kind of urban warfare Israel is being forced into by
its Islamic enemies. Or perhaps the ignorance is only feigned for the
sake of criticizing Israel? I don&#8217;t recall Amnesty producing such
damning reports against US forces operating in a similar fashion in
Iraq, or against Russia for its brutal military operations in Chechnya.
And if it did, they didn&#8217;t receive nearly the same media coverage.
According to the new report, Israel carried out &#8220;indiscriminate&#8221; attacks
against the Lebanese - meaning Israel didn&#8217;t care if it killed armed
Hizb&#8217;allah fighters or cute 12-year-old girls. Of course, anyone who has
bothered to acquaint themselves with Israel - with the underlying fear
of international public opinion and drives its diplomatic decisions and
the impossible level of morality that its people see themselves as bound
to - knows that Amnesty&#8217;s charge is simply not true. Furthermore, the
&#8220;human rights&#8221; organization says Israel employed massively
disproportionate force in dealing with its enemy. Does this make sense
to anyone? I mean, is Israel the only nation on earth that is not
allowed to engaged in the obviously necessary practice of employing
greater force than your enemy in order to win a war? It is a good thing
Amnesty was not around to hamper Allied war efforts during World War II,
or a good portion of the world would today be speaking German. The
report then goes on to turn its favorite screw - Israel&#8217;s use of cluster
bombs against targets in civilian areas. First of all, it is a known
military fact that cluster bombs are by far the most effective weapon
against mobile missile crews. Second, it is not Israel&#8217;s fault that
Hizb&#8217;allah missile crews operated almost exclusively out of civilian
areas. What was Israel supposed to do? Just sit back and ignore the
bombardment of its own civilians because Hizb&#8217;allah had so cleverly
shielded itself among civilians? An <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/99">accurate reading of the Fourth
Geneva Convention</a> provides Israel
full legitimacy in striking this enemy, even if it meant mass civilian
casualties. Amnesty needs to put things in perspective, and remember
that **if not for Hizb&#8217;allah** instigating the conflict and
attacking a neighboring state from inside towns and villages, **every
single one of those dead Lebanese civilians would be alive today**.
Naturally, Amnesty tried to cover itself by claiming that there was &#8220;no
evidence of Hizb&#8217;allah action&#8221; at many of the civilian sites attacked by
Israel. But, of course, there would not be. As mentioned before, the
Hizb&#8217;allah crews were highly mobile, and quickly left, or tried to
leave, after striking Israel. Furthermore, the deaths of civilians and
subsequent international condemnation of Israel is a PR victory for
Hizb&#8217;allah. Atop their agenda would be making sure there was no evidence
of terrorist activity from sites later hit by the Israelis. Amnesty is
smart enough to realize this. If only it were objective enough to
care&#8230;</p>
