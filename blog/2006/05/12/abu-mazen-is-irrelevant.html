<div class="entry-content"><p>Ehud Olmert&#8217;s intention to unilaterally surrender about 90 percent of
Judea and Samaria to the Arabs appears to have international power
brokers concerned that the era of Israeli-Palestinian bilateral
negotiations, and perhaps even official relations, is at an end. From
Washington to Brussels to Moscow, Israel is being pressured to look no
further than PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) in its dying search for
a true and viable peace partner, and thus avert unilateral action that
would put an end to the &#8220;land-for-peace&#8221; process. The international
community is backed in this regard by those Israeli leftists most
responsible for the now-defunct &#8220;Oslo Accords,&#8221; people like Uri Savir,
who wrote in Friday&#8217;s _Jerusalem Post_: > &#8220;Our real partner is&#8230;the
Palestinian people [sic] as embodied by their elected president.&#8221; Now, I
certainly do _not_ support Olmert&#8217;s planned surrender, but the
international community and its leftist Israeli allies are, whether
innocently or by design, guilty of some pretty serious oversights in
pressing for talks with Abu Mazen as an alternative. You see, Abu Mazen
cannot simply sign an agreement between his office and the State of
Israel. Any agreement will have to gain the approval of the elected
representatives of the Palestinians Arabs - the Hamas terrorists who now
control the entire government outside of the president&#8217;s office. What
good would a piece of paper with Abu Mazen&#8217;s signature be if the
&#8220;Palestinian&#8221; ministries of the interior, security, media, etc were not
implementing its terms? I&#8217;ll tell you how good it would be - about as
good as the before-mentioned Oslo Accords, the terms of which were also
never implemented by the &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; Though that never stopped the
world from patting itself on the back over those worthless scraps of
paper. But lets say for the sake of argument that Savir and the West are
betting on the right horse, that Abu Mazen is capable of making a deal
with Israel that will actually be implemented. Will it ever be possible
to reconcile the positions of the two sides? And if so, will the outcome
be one that does not endanger Israel&#8217;s future? Savir clearly thinks so:
> &#8220;&#8230;a peace mandate was [Abu Mazen&#8217;s] trump card in the Palestinian
presidential elections; he garnered massive support from his fellow
Palestinians to negotiate peace with Israel.&#8221; But like his colleagues,
this ultra-leftist is only telling part of the story here. Abu Mazen&#8217;s
&#8220;trump card&#8221; during last year&#8217;s election was &#8220;peace&#8221; based on unbending
demands that Israel divide its holy city and allow the Jewish state to
be flooded with millions of so-called Arab &#8220;refugees.&#8221; Abu Mazen&#8217;s
election platform had two facets - words of &#8220;peace&#8221; to keep the West
spellbound, and devotion to the core principles of the PLO&#8217;s &#8220;Phased
Plan&#8221; for the destruction of Israel. There was no facet that should
leave any Israeli believing this man&#8217;s _ultimate_ goal is not the same
as that of his former mentor and colleague, Yasser Arafat.</p>
