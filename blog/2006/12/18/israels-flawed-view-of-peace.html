<div class="entry-content"><p>I cannot remember the number of times I have been asked by visitors or
online friends what exactly is wrong with the Israelis, who seemingly
against all reason continue to capitulate to their enemies&#8217; demands in
some vain hope of peace. First, I would like to remind my
Bible-believing readers that this irrational behavior was foretold, and
should be expected as we near &#8220;the end.&#8221; > &#8220;Because they lead my people
astray, saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace&#8230;I will spend My wrath
against&#8230;those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw
visions of peace for her when there was no peace,&#8221; declares the
Sovereign LORD. (Ezekiel 13:10, 15-16) Well, that covers things from a
prophetic, spiritual standpoint, but even so, many still want to know
what is going on inside the heads of these Israelis, who believe that
through politically correct capitulation to Islam they can suddenly
bring to an end an existential religious war that has been raging for
thousands of years. I think we can gain a lot of insight into what these
seekers of a false peace are thinking by examining the words of Uri
Savir, the current director of the Peres (as in Shimon) Center for
Peace. Prior to holding that position, Savir joined Yossi Beilin and
other ultra-leftists in breaching Israeli law by meeting with Yasser
Arafat&#8217;s crew in Oslo, Norway and launching the now defunct peace
process. In an opinion piece published in The Jerusalem Post on November
29 of this year, Savir states the following: > &#8220;Rather than diplomacy
being perceived as the consequence following the use of force, diplomacy
should be viewed in its classical form as a mode of peace-making.&#8221; Savir
was referring both to Israel&#8217;s conflict with the Palestinian Arabs and
America&#8217;s global war on terror. I will only address the issue as it
relates to Israel, but what I have to say certainly applies to both the
Israeli and American efforts against the Islamic foe. Savir&#8217;s above
recommendation is worrying in that it so closely resembles the
appeasement-minded policies of British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain on the eve of World War II. In his great folly, Chamberlain
took Hitler&#8217;s peace overtures to be genuine, and opted for diplomacy
over victory. Millions paid with their lives for that decision. The
situation here today is a near mirror image. The Palestinian Arabs,
Syria, Saudi Arabia, etc all talk peace when they are speaking for
international consumption. And yet, like Hitler&#8217;s Germany, those nations
are all preparing their people for Israel&#8217;s destruction. A cursory
glance at the <a href="http://www.pmw.org.il/schoolbooks.html">textbooks used in Palestinian Authority
schools</a> reveals that Arab
children are being readied to lay down their lives for the cause of
eliminating the Jewish state. Dialogue, peace and co-existence are all
noble goals, but to ignore the true intentions of your enemy while
pursuing those goals is the kind of thing that only hastens the onset of
war. Like Chamberlain,Savir and other leading Israelis are basing their
policy of diplomacy on the false assumption that when presented with
goodwill gestures and concessions their enemies will respond in kind,
rather than leverage the situation to bleed Israel even further. One
would think that Israel would well understand this, having offered and
given so much to the Palestinian Arabs over the past decade, while
receiving in return nothing but an escalation in violence. The problem
lies in the fact that at least half of Israel still views the so-called
&#8220;Oslo Accords&#8221; as a positive development, a diplomatic victory. > The
1991 Madrid Conference &#8220;launched bilateral negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority&#8230; It may be the time for a second Madrid
Conference, serving to launch similar negotiations,&#8221; writes Savir.
Actually, the negotiations that were started were between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the world&#8217;s former foremost
terrorist network, the AlQaeda of its day. And in addition to creating
dialogue, this &#8220;peace&#8221; process provided the PLO with vast supplies of
arms and bases from which to operate in the heart of ancient Israel -
factors that have directly contributed to the murder and maiming of
thousands of Israelis. Difficult to see how this was a desirable
development, or one that should be repeated. These Israelis also
mistakenly believe that to the Muslim masses economic rewards are more
important than adherence to Islam, which demands that infidel tumors in
the heart of formerly Muslim-ruled lands must be removed. > &#8220;American
and Israeli peace policy should seek a comprehensive package in which
Israel would enjoy diplomatic relations with all Arab countries and the
Middle East would enjoy regional economic development with open borders
for trade&#8230;&#8221; You ever wonder why the heir of a construction empire like
Osama bin Laden would choose to dwell in caves in Afghanistan and live
the life of a terrorist on the run? It&#8217;s because for true believers in
Islam, adherence to Allah&#8217;s dictates are more important than money and
comfortable living. This is also demonstrated in the fact that surveys
show a large percentage of &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; homicide bombers were not poor
and desolate, but rather hailed from educated middle-class families. To
the purely secular mind that rejects the role of religion and faith in
such matters, and assumes that all sides are approaching the problem
with the same set of morals and desires - to that mind, all this talk of
a &#8220;new Middle East&#8221; and cooperative regional development sounds
perfectly reasonable. But it is that mind that has chosen to live in
blindness. It is that mind that has forgotten that without God&#8217;s Word,
without His divine appointment, Israel simply does not exist at all.
Fortunately, there is a sizable remnant in Israel that has its eyes
open, that is living according to and standing firmly upon the divine
promises made to their people. It is time we work to strengthen their
hands, rather than stand idly by as they are ripped from their homes by
short-sighted leaders who offer nothing but a false peace.</p>
