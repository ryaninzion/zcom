<div class="entry-content"><p>Lost among the escalating violence in the Palestinian
Authority-controlled territories is the fact that the present situation
is the direct result of the Palestinian Arabs democratically deciding
that they want the worst of the terrorists among them to be their
leaders. Israel, America, Europe, everybody pressed the Palestinian
Authority to allow true democratic elections. And then the general
public overwhelmingly elected Hamas. The argument that the people voted
for Hamas based on the group&#8217;s humanitarian work and its true distaste
for the kind of political corruption that had infected the PLO just
doesn&#8217;t hold water. There were a number of other parties that ran in
last January&#8217;s election, and some of them had even greater social
agendas and were even less prone to corruption than Hamas. The reason
Hamas won the people&#8217;s hearts and minds over those other parties is
because for more than a decade it had so successfully combined caring
for the Palestinian Arabs with mass murdering Israeli Jews. Oh, and a
word on Hamas&#8217; humanitarian and charitable activities - yes, the group
does some noble work, like running orphanages and giving food and
clothes to the needy. But the catch is that they also want to recruit
your sons and daughters to blow themselves up among crowds of Zionists.
Not exactly the kind of humanitarian group I would want operating in my
neighborhood. Anyway, back on topic. The Palestinian general public -
you know, those masses of poor, suffering Arabs that the international
community insists just want to live in peace with Israel, but who are
being hijacked by a small group of radicals - yes, them - they
overwhelmingly chose a group of the most blood-thirsty terrorists as
their representatives. I repeat: They CHOSE Hamas to represent and lead
them. And they were drawn to Hamas not because Hamas promised to provide
the same services that half a dozen other parties were also promising.
No, they were drawn to Hamas because of the group&#8217;s Jewish body count;
because of the blood-drenched glory and honor Hamas had brought to the
&#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; This represents an uncomfortable truth for the West and
its land-for-peace allies among Israeli leftists. You see, the
underlying premise of all Middle East policy for the past thirty years
has been that at the core of it all, the Palestinian Arabs just want to
live in peace with their Jewish neighbors and to have a normal life. The
election of Hamas, however, proves that the vast majority of Palestinian
Arabs in fact espouse the tenets of the Hamas charter. A couple of
choice samples: - &#8220;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until
Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.&#8221;
(Preamble) - &#8220;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except
through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are
all a waste of time and vain endeavors.&#8221; (Article 13) And now everyone
is pretending that if only there can be new elections in the Palestinian
Authority reinstalling Abu Mazen&#8217;s Fatah party as the dominant political
force, then all will be well. But for those with their eyes open, it&#8217;s
too late for that. As John F. Kennedy once said: > &#8220;Peace does not rest
in charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of the
people.&#8221; What&#8217;s in the hearts of most &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; is murderous intent
toward the Jewish state. So how can there be peace?</p>
