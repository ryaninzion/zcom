<div class="entry-content"><p>Before I get started - a note for those who may require this disclaimer:
I was being sarcastic in my headline. On to the subject at hand. Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a new year&#8217;s greeting to the world&#8217;s
Christians this week, <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53430">urging them to behave in the way he believes
Jesus would want them
to</a>. >
&#8220;My one question of the Christians is: What would Jesus do if he were
present in the world today? What would he do before some of the
oppressive powers of the world who are in fact residing in Christian
countries? Which powers would he revive and which of them would he
destroy?&#8221; Without question, pretty much all the nations of the world
stand to receive harsh judgment at Jesus&#8217; hands. But if Ahmadinejad had
bothered to read the Bible, he would note that his own Persia is set to
receive a special reprimand, and that at Israel&#8217;s hands no less: > Thus
says the Lord God: &#8220;Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh,
Meshech, and Tubal. I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws,
and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all
splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of
them handling swords. **Persia**, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them,
all of them with shield and helmet&#8230; > > &#8220;And it will come to pass at
the same time, when Gog [and its allies] comes against the land of
Israel,&#8221; says the Lord God, &#8220;that My fury will show in My face&#8230; > >
&#8220;I will call for a sword against Gog [and its allies] throughout all My
mountains,&#8221; says the Lord God. &#8230;And I will bring [those nations] to
judgment with pestilence and bloodshed.&#8221; (Ezekiel 38:3-5, 18, 21-22) But
according to the &#8220;Gospel of Ahmadinejad,&#8221; Jesus is destined to reappear
as a mere co-messiah with the Islamic messianic figure Imam Mahdi, and
both will do the will of Allah: > &#8220;All I want to say is that the age of
hardship, threat and spite will come to an end someday and, God willing,
Jesus would return to the world along with the emergence of the
descendant of the Islam&#8217;s holy prophet, Imam Mahdi, and wipe away every
tinge of oppression, pain and agony from the face of the world.&#8221;
Unfortunately for Ahmadinejad, he and his &#8220;mahdi&#8221; are in for a big
surprise. For when Jesus returns, he is coming as the Lion of JUDAH to
establish His kingdom in and from ISRAEL, and all other nations will bow
down to Him and to the God of Israel, NOT to the moon god of Mecca. I
would like to say &#8220;what a joke!&#8221; and dismiss Ahmadinejad&#8217;s assertions as
a madman&#8217;s ramblings that will be duly ignored by all Christians. But I
know better. I know that, sadly, there are a lot of liberal, politically
correct &#8220;Christians&#8221; out there that will openly welcome this letter that
so contradicts the Word of God.</p>
