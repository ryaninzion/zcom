<div class="entry-content"><p>While most of the mainstream media is extra careful to not label the
members of Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas as
terrorists, there are some who refuse to be so &#8220;open minded&#8221; as to
afford the murderers of men, women and children any such courtesy. That
minority of journalists, however, is often accused of unfairly slanting
the news and driving away the average user with &#8220;subjective&#8221; language.
Now, to get &#8220;objective&#8221; for a moment, a case can be made for not
regularly referring to Hezbollah as a terror group. While Hezbollah has
been involved in such clear acts of terrorism as the 1994 bombing of a
Jewish community center in Argentina, the bulk of its activities in
recent years do not fall under the definition of classical terrorism.
The case can be made that at present, Hezbollah would be more accurately
described as an armed militia, albeit an illegal one that international
law demands be disarmed. Hamas and other Palestinian groups, however, do
not merit any such consideration, as they have openly and proudly
claimed credit up until the present fornumerous actions with the sole
aim of mass murdering Israeli civilians - the very definition of
terrorism. To refuse to refer to Hamas and these other groups as
terrorists is the same as refusing to refer to Osama bin Laden&#8217;s Al
Qaeda as a terrorist organization. Many journalists will point to the
fact that popular opinion among Middle East Arab Muslims is that Hamas
is not a terror group, and so to refer to it as such would be an
exercise in subjectivity by presenting events through a
Western,Judeo-Christian lens. But again, there are many - and I mean
very many - in the Middle East who likewise do not see Al Qaeda as a
terrorist organization. Assuming that these journalists view the bombing
of buses, cafes and shopping malls as acts of terrorism, then it only
follows that those who commit such atrocities are in fact terrorists. If
AlQaeda are terrorists for crashing airliners into the World Trade
Center, then Hamas are terrorists for blowing up passenger buses in
downtown Jerusalem. So what differentiates the two groups? Why is one
group comfortably referred to as being terrorist in nature, while
journalists so vigorously refuse to apply the same label to the other?
Some will note that Hamas, like Hezbollah, is also a political party,
deeply involved in Palestinian government. But that argument breaks down
once you note that the Taliban and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -
just to name a couple - were or still are likewise involved in
government. The true differentiating factor - and one that the media
will never admit to - is that while Al Qaeda is killing all manner of
Westerners, Hamas is devoted solely to the murder of Jews, and
specifically those Jews who dare to take up residence in their ancient,
formerly Muslim-dominated homeland. Don&#8217;t believe me? Think I am
unjustly playing the anti-Semitism card? Look at it this way: 1. A
person straps a bomb to his body and purposely detonates said bomb on
board a packed passenger bus; 2. Tens and perhaps hundreds of people are
either killed or maimed as the intended result of that action; 3. A
group or organization releases a statement to the effect that the bomber
was one of its own and was acting on its behalf; 4. The leaders of the
attacked nation or community make concessions to the assailants in hopes
of forestalling future violence. Anywhere else in the world, this is
terrorism. Terrorism by its very definition has occurred: Unarmed
civilians have been terrorized through violence with the aim of
extracting political concessions. Those who have engaged in this
practice are terrorists. Sorry to play the same old card again, but to
apply a double standard and not recognize the perpetrators of such a
strategy as terrorists just because the victims are Israeli Jews is
anti-Semitism.</p>
