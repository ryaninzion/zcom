<div class="entry-content"><p>As with any terrorist attack, the aftermath of Monday&#8217;s Tel Aviv bombing
is fraught with <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3240930,00.html">heart-rending
stories</a> of
personal tragedy. The most tear-jerking of the lot involves a father,
Philip Balhasan, who was visiting Tel Aviv with his two youngest
children after promising to take them to the city to buy some CDs and
computer games as a treat for Passover. As soon as the &#8220;Palestinian&#8221;
killer detonated himself, sending a piece of shrapnel into Balhasan&#8217;s
heart, the loving father embraced his children tightly, told them to
call their mother, and collapsed. A short time later he was dead. Now,
the Palestinian Arabs and their apologists the world over will attempt
to draw moral equivalency with, say, the unintentional killing last week
of a nine-year-old Arab girl during an Israeli strike on known
terrorists in the Gaza Strip - an event certainly no less tragic for
that girl&#8217;s family. The difference of course lies in the fact Israel was
targeting terrorists, most of them armed at the time, who were cynically
using civilians such as that little girl as cover - a war crime under
the Geneva Conventions. Monday&#8217;s &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; bomber, on the other
hand, intentionally targeted civilians, including children, out on the
town en masse during the Passover holiday. Imagine if Israel really did
carry out acts equivalent in their moral repugnancy to those perpetrated
by the &#8220;Palestinians.&#8221; Imagine if an Israeli, willing to give his own
life for the sake of slaughtering as many &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; as possible,
and enjoying the consent of his government, walked in to a crowded
Ramallah eatery one Ramadan evening and mowed down scores of Muslim
patrons. Can anyone imagine the enormity of the international outcry?
Again, the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; and their apologists will point to Baruch
Goldstein and Eden Natan Zada as evidence that such attacks are carried
out by Jews against Arabs. But Goldstein&#8217;s Hebron massacre and Zada&#8217;s
Shfaram bus attack were isolated events, whereas the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have
mass murdered Jewish civilians almost more times than can be counted.
Nor did either Goldstein or Zada enjoy the support of their government
or countrymen, but were rather treated posthumously as criminals and
traitors. There simply is no moral equivalency between the combatants in
this conflict, or between the two peoples and their governments. For the
world to continue treating Israel and its Arab foes on equal moral
footing is only perpetuating the bloodshed.</p>
