<div class="entry-content"><p>Israel, America and Europe have taken a good first step by cutting off
both aid to and contact with the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Yet
all three continue this ridiculous charade of dealing with Mahmoud
Abbas, head of the PLO and &#8220;president&#8221; of the PA, as if he were some
separate entity capable of making decisions and implementing policy on
his own. The PA is more democratic than most governments in this region
because of Western pressure. The West can&#8217;t have its cake and eat it too
by now expecting Abbas to exercise dictatorial powers. In fact, it was
the West that pushed for Abbas&#8217; current post to either be eliminated or
made purely ceremonial. What they got was a PA equivalent in
functionality to a US Congress that appoints all government secretaries
and exercises full control over the military, while the president is
still considered the chief executive. The result is chaos and
instability. Abbas&#8217; utter impotence in this morass of power was again
demonstrated in the aftermath of Monday&#8217;s Tel Aviv &#8220;suicide&#8221; bombing.
The PLO chief condemned the attack for the harm it had done to the
&#8220;Palestinian cause&#8221; (he would take a different route to relieving the
Jews of their homeland), while the Hamas government backed it as a
legitimate act of &#8220;self defense.&#8221; Guess who&#8217;s word matters more. In the
current set-up, Abbas&#8217; displeasure with Monday&#8217;s massacre will result in
not even one arrest or any action to prevent additional atrocities. The
reason this untenable situation exists is because the West and the
Israeli government in their misguided handling of the &#8220;peace&#8221; process
believed they could side-step Yasser Arafat&#8217;s intransigence by forcing
him to create and transfer his own powers to the position of prime
minister - essentially transforming the PA from a presidential system of
government to a parliamentary one. The only problem was everyone assumed
the blood-soaked demagogue Arafat would fully relinquish his lucrative
absolute hold on government. He didn&#8217;t, and the vast power he retained
for himself then passed to Abbas with the blessing of the West, which
had apparently forgotten that it previously wanted the position of PA
&#8220;president&#8221; to be bestowed with no more real political power than the
English Throne. Well, that worked out OK so long as the majority
parliament faction, and therefore the prime minister and his cabinet,
were all of the same party as Abbas. But democracy doesn&#8217;t work that
way, and the people voted in Hamas. And so the time has come for Israel
and the West to recognize the mistake they made when Arafat was in power
and either endorse Abbas as an absolute dictator, or acknowledge his
irrelevance. Obviously the latter option would be chosen in line with
America&#8217;s democracy agenda, which would then necessitate recognizing
that the vast majority of &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; knowingly and willingly chose a
group of unrepentant terrorist killers as their leaders - something the
West is trying feverishly to avoid doing, at least publicly. It&#8217;s time
for some tough decisions. Are Israel and her allies in Washington up to
it? I doubt it. Though Hamas through its own actions may take the luxury
of choice out of everyone&#8217;s hands.</p>
