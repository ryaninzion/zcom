  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to inform the Zionist.com community of a new Israeli-created
political news website that I think will interest many of you news and
politics junkies. <a href="http://www.skewz.com">Skewz</a> is similar to other
&#8220;social&#8221; news sites in that you have to register as a member of the site
before submitting the stories and links that make up the site&#8217;s content.
It then departs from the norm by offering a sliding scale you can use to
filter what stories and links you are shown based on political slant,
ranging from radically left-wing to far right-wing. I, for one, find
this very useful, as I typically depend on trusted blogs and other
personal commentary sites to bring me up to speed on political issues I
may run across but have little understanding of. For example, I have
been in Israel my entire adult life, so have little understanding of the
health care debate that is such a major fixture of the US presidential
campaign. When something happens or is said regarding this issue, I
usually scan the mainstream media reports about it, and then head to the
blogs and commentary sites to learn the background info. Now, when I do
this, I prefer to be schooled by authors who share my conservative
outlook (though I don&#8217;t shy away from peeking at what the other side it
saying also). But with most social news sites that aggregate blogs and
commentary websites, I receive a deluge of results from left-leaning
writers. <a href="http://www.skewz.com">Skewz</a> allows me to eliminate that
clutter and be served results that are more in line with how I would
view the topic, if I was more knowledgeable about American health care.
The user base at Skewz is not very big yet, so the content selection is
still a bit slim. But with the presidential election just around the
corner, I think the site will grow quickly and will become a great
resource for folks like me. Check it out:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like many others, I was initially shocked when I read last week that US
intelligence had determined with &#8220;moderate confidence&#8221; that Iran
abandoned its quest for nuclear weapons in 2003. Hadn&#8217;t US intelligence
determined just 11 months earlier with a far greater degree of
confidence that Iran was determined, despite the potential consequences,
to develop nuclear military power? From the <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/inr/rls/79065.htm">US Annual Threat
Assessment</a> delivered on
January 11, 2007: > We assess that Tehran is determined to develop
nuclear weapons&#8211;despite its international obligations and international
pressure. But then I began to process this development in the context of
the rest of the news surrounding it. Like his father and Bill Clinton
before him, President George W. Bush is determined to carve out for
himself a positive legacy before the end of his presidency. Mr. Bush
can&#8217;t do that if his second terms ends with the entire Muslim world
hating him. And while there is little hope of convincing the Muslim
world to suddenly love America, let alone the Bush Administration, there
is no hope whatsoever of that happening if Israel strikes Iran with
tacit US approval. Israeli leaders responded to the US intelligence
report by stressing that Israeli intelligence did not concur with the
conclusions, and that Israel would still strike Iran if it felt there
was no other option. But an Israel cabinet minister <a href="http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=37147">told <em>Time</em>
magazine</a> what everyone knows to
be true: that the US report had effectively taken the option of a
preemptive Israeli strike off the table, since Israel did not intend to
attack Iran without the green light the Olmert government believes it
needs from Washington. In addition to that, I believe, as do others I
have spoken to, that the findings of this report are part of the overall
scheme to divide the Land of Israel. Again, like his father and Bill
Clinton before him, the creation of a Palestinian Arab state would be
the jewel in the crown Bush hopes will be his legacy. Bush declared with
messianic vigor in 2004 that he would be the one to <a href="http://www.jnewswire.com/article/268">bring peace to the
Middle East</a>, and he is determined
to see that pledge through. However, Mr. Bush only has one year left to
get things done, and we are no further along in the &#8220;peace&#8221; process
today than we were 10 years ago. How in the world could this situation
possibly be brought to a head in just one year? Well, it certainly won&#8217;t
if there are other major regional concerns, like a nuclear Iran. So the
US took that concern off the table in order to focus maximum attention
on ramming through the division of the Land of Israel. If you ask me,
Bush and Rice are not to be believed when they express frustration over
the findings of the intelligence report. This is all part of the plan.
<a href="http://www.stangoodenough.com/?p=94">Stan has written a must-read analysis of this
situation</a>, explaining how the US
intelligence report is only the latest piece of evidence that in the
end, Israel will stand alone with no national friends or allies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received the following email this week from a man whose US-based
ministry has long fought to defend Israel and its biblical right to this
land. He and others like him are urgently calling for all Israel-loving
Bible believers to make their way to Washington, DC and Annapolis,
Maryland to confront the latest satanic attempt to divide this land and
thwart God&#8217;s plans. > Jerusalem is in danger. The nation of Israel is
in danger. Our families and communities are in danger. There is a battle
raging, a revolution formulating and it is not focused on the Jews
alone. What we see happening in Israel today with the people who refer
to themselves as Palestinians is merely a war by proxy aimed at
controlling God&#8217;s very throne, the place where He said His name would be
known FOREVER, Jerusalem, more precisely Mount Moriah - the Temple
Mount. > > If Islam can dominate the land of Israel and push the Jews
into the Mediterranean (which to this day is the stated goal of PLO
charter) there will be no stabilizing force to hold back the pan-Arab
takeover of the Asian and African Continents, there will be no bridle in
the mouth of the descendants of Ishmael who God Himself foretold would
be a wild ass among men. Make no mistake about it, Islam is a revolution
on a global scale. The Imams are teaching that their pseudo-god provided
his faithful followers with an abundant supply of oil to fund the spread
of Islam throughout the Earth. The oil is running out with only another
twenty years left to accomplish their deed. This, to the point of total
domination, where the infidel or unbeliever is only allowed to survive
as a slave and is heavily taxed. This can already be seen happening in
most of the Islamic countries throughout the world today. > > My point
is this - Right now the framework is being set for an unprecedented take
over of Israel&#8217;s biblical inheritance. If Islam takes control of the
land now being proposed, not only will there not be peace in the Middle
East, the stage will be set for insurrection throughout the world.
<strong>There is a unique opportunity to make a stand to help protect Israel
from Arab aggression while never leaving American soil.</strong> We can make a
difference, together, at a time when Israel is having her arm twisted by
an administration desperate to create a legacy for itself at the expense
of the Jewish people. > > We can lift our voices in opposition at the
front of the White House and at the front gate of the Annapolis Naval
Academy. Permits to assemble have been secured at both venues on the
dates of the conference in Annapolis. We need voices. We need faithful
believers who can come together and say to the mountain of political
coercion facing Israel, be removed. > > A coalition of Jewish and
Christian organizations is working together to rally support for Israel
and defend Jerusalem from Arab aggression. The dates for the rallies are
November 25 at the White House and the 26th and 27th at Annapolis. > >
Sincerely, > Ed Warmoth > Builders of Zion Executive Director >

<a href="www.buildersofzion.org">www.buildersofzion.org</a> > US Phone:
407-971-7631 These guys clearly understand that this battle is a
spiritual one at its root, and that action is needed. Many Christians,
even ones who firmly support and love Israel, believe that since
everything is ultimately in God&#8217;s hands anyway, there is no need for us
to take action. This position is wrong. If anything, the Bible teaches
us that God desires to accomplish His will through us. He has honored us
by inviting us to partner with Him, and we should not miss that
opportunity. If you are able, make every effort to be one of those
physically and publicly standing for Israel when later this month the
nations of the world again come against her to try and wrest control of
the most important and strategic parts of this land.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently made aware of an online petition currently making the
rounds that I would encourage everyone who opposes the surrender of even
one inch of the biblical Land of Israel to the Muslim Arab world to
sign. The petition comes in two forms: a motion of no-confidence in the
Israeli government for Israeli citizens to sign, and a Declaration of
Solidarity for non-Israelis to sign. Both, say the organizers of the
petition, will act to give courage to Israeli lawmakers to stand up to
their out-of-control government that seems bent on capitulating to the
enemies of the Jewish state. The petition can be found here:
<a href="http://www.strongisrael.org">www.strongisrael.org</a> While this petition
alone is unlikely to sway Olmert, who insists he is under no obligation
to seek even the Knesset&#8217;s approval in negotiating away Israel&#8217;s
birthright, it never hurts to let Israelis know just how many people out
there stand firmly with their right to possess all of their God-given
heritage. Also, the website linked above has a wealth of information
regarding the true intentions of the &#8220;moderate&#8221; Palestinian forces
Olmert will find himself across the table from in Annapolis next month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Former Israeli Knesset Member and Minister of Justice Tommy Lapid argued
persuasively, but erroneously in a recent <em>Jerusalem Post</em> op-ed that
both Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu
are right in their contrasting approaches to the peace process. Olmert
knows that he must at least try to engage the Arabs in dialogue, and
wean his nation off the belief that all the dreams, hopes and prayers of
generations of Jews can be fulfilled in the midst of the present
conflict, wrote Lapid. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Netanyahu is wrong to warn
of the dangers inherent in Olmert&#8217;s course of action. If the weak and
seemingly incapable regime of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud
Abbas, with whom Olmert is negotiating the surrender of the West Bank,
is again defeated by Hamas as it was in Gaza, &#8220;not only Tel Aviv&#8230;will
share the fate of Sderot, but so will Ben-Gurion Airport, cutting off
Israel&#8217;s ties with the world,&#8221; Lapid conceded. Israel, Lapid concluded,
simply has no choice but to soldier on along this path of disparate
political approaches, as &#8220;there is no practical solution to the conflict
in sight. &#8230;Some situations have no solutions. And for the time being,
life goes on.&#8221; That conclusion sounds reasonable, if not bleak, on the
surface, but falls apart if we dig a little deeper. Lapid fails to
entertain the option of one side in this equation - either the right led
by Netanyahu, or the left led by Olmert - waking up to reality and
backing the other&#8217;s position. While it is unlikely to happen, examining
the consequences of such an occurrence shows precisely why both sides
are not right. If, as Lapid accepts, Netanyahu is correct in his current
assertion that true and lasting peace cannot be made with the Abbas-led
Palestinian Authority regardless of how much Israel gives, then for
Netanyahu and the bulk of his followers to adopt Olmert&#8217;s position would
lead to catastrophe. However, for Olmert and the left to adopt
Netanyahu&#8217;s position would signal a seismic shift in an increasingly
pointless diplomatic process that has produced plenty of photo
opportunities and little peace since its inception more than a decade
ago. Lapid suggests that the right&#8217;s alternative to Olmert actively
pursuing doomed land-for-peace negotiations with the Palestinians is to
create a diplomatic vacuum, to more or less ignore the issue all
together. Lapid is right that such a scenario would invite &#8220;pressures
that we would find it impossible to withstand.&#8221; But Lapid is wrong in
thinking that the right&#8217;s substitute for offering strategic concessions
to an intractable foe is diplomatic idleness. Netanyahu has long
insisted that it is his desire to find a truly workable solution to the
conflict, and one of the right&#8217;s more active members in this arena,
National Union Party chief Rabbi Benny Elon, just launched a thoroughly
detailed alternative peace plan of his own. The ideas being put forth by
the right might not result in bilateral peace, but for the nation at
large to embrace them would signal to the world that Jewish history and
Israeli security are no longer being offered as sacrifices on the alter
of a false peace. And that would restore national pride, dignity and a
willingness to fight for Israel&#8217;s rights to levels that have not been
seen since the early years of the Jewish state&#8217;s rebirth. Lapid and
others on the left see the right&#8217;s alternatives as little more than hot
air because Israelis have been trained over the past decade by an
idealistic peace movement to view such proposals as wildly unrealistic.
How many times over the past three years alone have we heard Olmert and
Ariel Sharon before him lament that holding on to the full Zionist dream
has become an unfeasible and even irrational notion? The truth is that
the concept of land-for-peace has become unrealistic, just as the
insistence that this is a purely political and nationalistic struggle
that has nothing to do with religion has become untenable. The lesson
Israelis should have learned over the past decade as a result of
continued Palestinian intransigence and Hamas gains is that concessions
and goodwill are clearly not going to lead to peace, and offering them
will only embolden an enemy that has no intention of relinquishing its
quest to ultimately regain all that was once under Islam&#8217;s dominion.
Lapid is right in seeing no practical solution to the conflict. He is
wrong in thinking that Israel has no choice but to go along with this
moribund process anyway, to the detriment of its own cause and the well
being of its citizens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Israel&#8217;s wayward leadership is trying to cleverly minimize the damage
done to their nation at the upcoming US-hosted peace summit in Annapolis
by insisting that the faltering Middle East peace process remain tied to
the Washington-backed Road Map peace plan. The reason for hoisting the
Road Map as the standard for peacemaking is that the plan is a
performance-based one that if accurately followed would require the
Palestinians to finally provide Israel with the peace, security and rest
from aggression it has so long sought. Failure on the Palestinians&#8217; part
to do so is supposed to negate Israel&#8217;s obligation to turn over any
additional territory. So what do the Palestinians do? They naturally
launch a campaign to convince the Bush Administration and other world
leaders that they have <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/135025">already fulfilled all their obligations under
the first phase of the Road
Map</a>, and are
now awaiting Israel&#8217;s reciprocation. It is a laughable claim, but
unfortunately for Israel it is probably enough to outflank Jerusalem&#8217;s
diplomatic position since Washington and the world have never been much
for fact-checking when it comes to Palestinian assertions, regardless of
how wild they may be. The very fact that we are talking about a people
group known as the &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; at all is evidence of that. So what
does Phase One of the US-authored Road Map demand of the Palestinians?
To put it simply, the Road Map demands that the Palestinian leadership
explicitly recognize Israel&#8217;s right to exist in this region, renounce
and combat the use of terrorist violence against Israelis, and put an
end to incitement against Israel and the Jews in the Palestinian media
and school system. I doubt it is necessary to expound upon how these
commitments have been anything but fulfilled by the Palestinian
Authority. Suffice it to say that Palestinian leaders (when speaking in
Arabic) continue to employ language that provides hope of one day
eradicating Jewish sovereignty, successful and attempted attacks on
Israelis continue unabated, and Palestinian children are still being
taught by their teachers and favorite television characters to loathe
the Jews and seek &#8220;martyrdom&#8221; while fighting them. Tens minutes on the
Internet making elementary use of Google is sufficient to punch numerous
holes in the latest Palestinian diplomatic position. The question is
whether Washington will champion truth and justice, or if it will put
perceived American interests in the Middle East ahead of Israeli lives
and again sell the Jewish state down the river.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The international community will bring the Israelis and Arabs together
in Annapolis, Maryland next month to again try to solve the Middle East
conflict according to its own wisdom and humanist agenda. It will fail,
as it has every other time, and it looks like Jerusalem will once again
be the stumbling block that prevents any real progress down the false
path to peace. Israel&#8217;s deputy prime minister is openly admitting that
the <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3457214,00.html">division of Jerusalem will be on the
table</a> at the
upcoming summit. Even Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, once the mayor of what
he insisted would always be the &#8220;eternal, undivided capital&#8221; of the
Jewish people, seems to be backing that position. But rather than jump
on the offer and then work to get more later, the Palestinians are
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257255317&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">hardening their
positions</a>
before negotiations have even began, making demands that would
necessitate uprooting well over 100,000 Jews from densely populated
neighborhoods - a concession the Palestinians know full well Olmert is
simply in no position to make. Why would they do this? Why would the
Palestinians make demands they know it is impossible for Olmert to meet,
instead of taking everything he is offering now and then demanding more
later? The Palestinians and the backers of their cause claim that offers
that do not meet 100% of their demands cannot be accepted because doing
so would prevent them from ever reaching their full goals. I would like
to note that in 1993, Yasser Arafat and his PLO ostensibly renounced the
use of terrorist violence against Israel and recognized the right of the
Jewish state to exist. That, however, clearly did not stop Arafat and
his Palestinians from employing terrorist violence against Israel and
seeking Jewish state&#8217;s ultimate demographic demise through a
&#8220;Palestinian right of return.&#8221; So why now would accepting most of
eastern Jerusalem prevent the Palestinians from continuing their
&#8220;struggle&#8221; to ultimately wrest control of all Jerusalem from the Jews?
Arafat also seemed to be stricken by this lack of logic when in 2000 he
turned down Ehud Barak&#8217;s offer of about 95 percent of Judea and Samaria,
including the eastern half of Jerusalem. This was the same Arafat who
knew in 1993 that he could sign deals with Israel and then not live up
to his side of the bargain, while retaining the support of the world for
future concessions. Something or someone muddled Arafat&#8217;s thinking in
2000, just as Abbas&#8217; is being muddled now. To me, it is clear that the
Lord is hardening the hearts of Israel&#8217;s enemies to prevent the world
and Israel&#8217;s own delusional leaders from going too far down this path of
destruction. That should come as no surprise to those who read and
believe the Bible. Zechariah 12 states that in these days Jerusalem will
be made a stumbling block, an immovable stone to all the nations that
try to move it, a hindrance to their plans. Expect the Annapolis summit
to fail (even if the leaders make some kind of &#8220;feel good&#8221; statement at
its closing), and expect Jerusalem to be the reason. Other good takes on
the planned division of Jerusalem: <a href="http://muqata.blogspot.com/2007/10/jerusalem-who-is-real-mother.html">Jameel over at the
Muqata</a>
notes that in the Bible, the mother who was willing to divide the baby
she claimed as hers was revealed by Solomon to not be the true mother.
<a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2007/10/pa-willingly-cedes-control-of-jerusalem.html">The Elder of
Zion</a>
points to an Arab report that the Palestinians are willing to put
Jerusalem under Jordanian sovereignty - kind of a &#8220;if we can&#8217;t have it,
then neither can the Jews&#8221; move. However, if the Palestinians are so
ready to let the Jordanians come in, is Jerusalem really as important to
them as they claim?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A young and by all account passionate Christian man was stabbed to death
in the Gaza Strip this past weekend in an incident that should highlight
precisely the kind of &#8220;free&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant&#8221; society the Bush
Administration and the international community are trying to create by
pushing for the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state. The young man
in question, 31-year-old Rami Ayyad, was the director of Gaza&#8217;s only
major Christian bookstore, and had been <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257240876&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">repeatedly threatened by local
Muslim elements for his sharing of the
Gospel</a>.
It would seem he was not intimidated by those threats, and continued to
share the love and message of the Lord. He paid for his faith and
faithfulness with his life. Ayyad was married with two small children
and a third on the way. Regurgitating the propaganda of the Palestinian
Authority and Hamas, the international media maintains that relations
between Christians and Muslims in Gaza are generally good. The reality
is that attacks and acts of intimidation have been increasing for years,
and that Christians there are merely tolerated, and that only when they
submit to dhimmi status. The most at risk are those who, like Ayyad,
share the Gospel with their Muslim neighbors, and those who accept that
message and open their hearts to the Lord (they are locally referred to
as MBBs - Muslim Background Believers, because they live in fear of
shedding the title &#8220;Muslim&#8221;). It is sickening to me that the world is
always at the ready to jump on Israel over any and every alleged
infringement of freedom of religion, but completely ignores the plight
of Palestinian Christians persecuted by their Muslim overlords. What
frustrates me even more are those American Christian organizations and
churches that actively bolster the claim that it is Israel that
oppresses these Christians. Israel did not kill Ayyad. Israel did not
bomb Ayyad&#8217;s bookstore or the Gaza Bible Society that runs it. Israel
does not send threatening letters to Arab Christians who dare to share
the love of Jesus with their Muslim neighbors. It is time to stop
misappropriating blame and time to start supporting brave souls like
Ayyad who put everything on the line, literally, to bring the truth
where it is most dangerous to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those who read this blog are fully aware that the Palestinian Authority
of Mahmoud Abbas is a supporter and facilitator of Muslim terrorism, but
it never hurts to remind everyone else of that fact and introduce new
evidence as to why this man and his government should not be sitting
across the negotiating table from our own leaders. Last week, a
prominent female Palestinian figure and lawmaker <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123830">issued a very public
&#8220;thank you&#8221; to
Abbas</a> after
his government resumed direct financial aid to terrorists jailed or
wounded by Israeli security forces and to the families of terrorists who
died while attacking Jews. Did you get that? Abbas is handing out money
to terrorists and their families who are adversely affected by engaging
in terrorist violence against Israeli Jews. How exactly is that
discouraging terrorism? How does that make Abbas a true peace partner?
Now, this kind of behavior from the Palestinian leadership is pretty
much par for the course. What is maddening is to listen to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert insist that <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1189411453780&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter">Abbas is a man of
peace</a>
and to US President George W. Bush claim that <a href="http://www.zoa.org/2007/09/zoa_criticizes_43.htm">the Palestinian leader is
combatting anti-Israel
terrorism</a>. Could
these guys have their heads any deeper in the sand? Didn&#8217;t the Bush
Administration make a big deal just a few years ago about Saddam Hussein
distributing financial compensation to the families of Palestinian
suicide bombers? How are Abbas&#8217; actions any different? Following the
September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, Bush insisted that leaders and
nations around the globe are either with us or with the terrorists. What
he forgot to mention was that the apparent exception to that rule are
the Palestinians, who continue to be permitted to openly keep one foot
in the terrorists&#8217; camp and the other in the White House.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I joined the International Christian Zionist Center (ICZC) Feast of
Tabernacles celebration again today as the group visited and held a
worship service on the ancient steps of the Temple Mount. It was a
beautiful and inspiring experience that most everyone there agreed had
spiritually opened the gates for increased Christian efforts to bring
about the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. Part of those efforts
will be - God willing - the annual presence of God-fearing,
Israel-loving Christians proclaiming the Lord&#8217;s truth regarding Israel
and the coming of her king and messiah from this very location. The spot
where the service was held will be known to any who have visited Israel.
It is on the ancient unearthed steps that extend from the southern end
of the Temple Mount, just under the Al Aqsa Mosque - the site Muslims
claim as Islam&#8217;s third holiest. The ICZC event experienced tremendous
growth this year that can only be attributed to the Lord&#8217;s blessing and
favor. If that percentage of growth continues next year, these ancient
steps will be the only other place in Jerusalem other than the Jerusalem
Convention Center (which the Christian Embassy already uses) that can
accommodate such a gathering. Pray the Lord will give the ICZC favor to
secure the ancient Temple Mount steps for every evening of next year&#8217;s
feast. Needless to say, the Muslims inside Al Aqsa were not too happy
about 500 Christians proclaiming God&#8217;s Word, praying for Israel&#8217;s full
restoration, and worshiping the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob just
outside their windows. Throughout the service Muslims inside the mosque
could be seen watching us from the windows, and even taking pictures of
the group. Pray that the spirit of Islam will quickly be broken over
this holy hill, and that as many as possible of those Muslims whose
hearts and minds are held captive by Allah will be freed. It really
seems that we are nearing something big. Events like this reinforce the
feeling that we are very rapidly nearing the end of all things
prophesied in His Word. And we will be even closer next year when
thousands of Christians who love His Name and His Word gather nightly at
the steps of His ancient and future temple to worship and do warfare
against the spirit of Islam.</p>
